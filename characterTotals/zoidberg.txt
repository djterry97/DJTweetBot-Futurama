 Welcome home, heroes!
 Ready? Leela, Professor, don't do this! It's too exciting!
 Hooray! A tie!
 It's the end of Planet Express and life as we know it.
 I'm Zoidberg. Nice to meet you!
 [quickly] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 Hey, hey, LBJ. You wanna get drunk?
 Uh... Not bad. A hint of vitalis and—
 Right on! Say, you got any real soup or just this schlock?
 Far out! That head gave me a total head trip!
 Fuh! Schlock and more schlock!
 Why with all the crying? [He looks across the room.] So that's where I left my shell.
 It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!
 So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
 A feast is a feast.
 Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already! [He puts the catalogue on the coffee table and it opens up like a laptop. It emits a holographic stereotypical Mexican shell onto his body.] Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!
 You Latins are so hot-blooded! [He changes the shell and the new one looks like the outfit worn by the cop from The Village People.] This one's like a summer guy!
 And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside. [He slurps.] Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?
 Ah!
 Let's watch, shall we?
 What's this? Two meals in one week?
 Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me! [Farnsworth throws a switch and the enlarging ray comes down and enlarges Zoidberg.] What?
 So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? [He walks towards a building.] Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? [He growls and knocks the building in half. He turns around.] Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. "Boo" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
 Tell it to claw.
 Stop!
 Hmm?
 Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
 What?
 Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. [He puts on a deerstalker and pulls out a magnifying glass.] Zoidberg is afoot!
 Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? [Hermes dives into the room but is dragged out again.] Is it anteater number two? [Leela runs in, grabs an axe and runs out again.] Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! [An anteater makes a noise.] What? How do you spell that?
 [shouting] Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things.
 Ah, the gang's all here.
 Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! [Everyone except Leela gasps. She gasps theatrically.] You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
 My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
 So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! [Nibbler squeals and points at Leela. The lights go off and Leela stabs Nibbler. They come back on and Nibbler is sandwiched between Scruffy and Cubert. An envelope comes through the door. Zoidberg reads the letter inside.] A letter from Bender, my good friend. [reading] Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- [He looks up from the letter.] My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
 If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
 Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
 Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?
 Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?
 No, I mean 40 pounds!
 Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows! [The cherry appears in front of him.] Ooh, and a cherry!
 Uh-oh!
 [from inside] One ship is left only.
 Yes.
 And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
 What, do I smell or something?
 And why did I have to take a cab?
 Alright!
 Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?
 No, world, you put your hands up!
 Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
 Sorry, I get aroused in crowds.
 [throws out his shell phone] Good riddance.
 But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture.
 Don't feel bad.  At least you're not Leela.
 What? What's going on here?
 The doctor is in! [Fry does a somersault and shoots at Zoidberg. He fizzles.] The doctor is out!
 Hello.
 [crying] That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
 [He and Cubert are standing near the fossil of a long-necked reptile.] Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! [Cubert looks at him, deadpan.] What, too soon?
 I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
 [To Cubert.] He's good.
 Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.
 Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
 Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall. [He points to a crude drawing of himself and Cubert in costume.] This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?
 [Sadly.] Father-Man away. [He scuttles off. Cubert looks ashamed.]
 Go on.
 Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? [He bursts into tears.]
 And that's that.
 So, you wanna come in maybe? [He opens the other lid.] I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.
 Good, cause I'm sick of him!
 [Over credits.] I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
 Good evening, ladies and germs. [The band plays a rimshot.] That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. [In the audience a big green germ waves.] Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. [He grins. There is no rimshot and the audience don't laugh. A man drums his fingers on the table.] Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again.
 I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
 If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it.
 A successor to the Professor?
 You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
 [writing] Blood ... thicker ... water.
 He's horrible!
 No.
 Mmm!
 I lost it ... in a volcano.
 Oh.
 Fry, my friend, I found your pants! [Fry happily takes the pants and puts them on.] And no sign of that crafty badger!
 A giant pyramid under New New York? What badger could have built this?
 The balcony club? I have an individual membership!
 I am lost! So long.
 It was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence.
 That guy stinks.
 [He approaches Leela.] Don't worry, Leela! Earth is still there. Peaceful and serene as ever.
 Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela.
 [defensively] I'm not on trial here.
 Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying "One more can't hurt" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
 That stench. That heavenly stench! [He gobbles up the rest of the pizza.] More!
 More! More! More! More!
 You know Zapp Brannigan?
 Aha!
 You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
 Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
 Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
 [opening the coffin] Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
 [singing] Oh, Danny-boy,
 [singing] From glen to glen and down--
 I'm expressing my sorrow.
 [singing] Oh, Danny-boy--
 Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
 And I'm his friend Jesus!
 I help those who help themselves.
 [singing] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
 There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
 No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!
 Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it.
 That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares.
 That's what I'm talking about!
 I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
 Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!
 I'm all scuttled out! [He looks up and sees something.] Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
 I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry.
 Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. [The woman comes back in with the cocoa and hands it to Zoidberg.] What, no marshmallows?
 Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
 Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!
 You bet!
 Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
 None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. [shouting] Glob!
 Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer.
 He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
 Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
 All eyes on Zoidberg! [Old Man Waterfall's hand pops off his arm but still clutches the flagpole.] Ew!
 Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!
 Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet.
 You're a nice man, Nixon.
 Oh, I couldn't.
 Well, maybe just a taste. [He takes a bite and cameras flash.] Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag! [The crowd cheers and Zoidberg raises the flag.] I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
 Huh? I thought it was mine!
 Tell me about it.
 Watch and learn.
 Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died.
 Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife.
 That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money.
 Finally, some respect.
 Barbados Slim? I love that guy.
 What's that thing on your neck?
 I guess. What does it do?
 Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.
 Aawww...
 There was one, but now there's two.
 ... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.
 Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens.
 [pouring some liquid from Hermes' jar into the bowl] Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this.
 I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging.
 He was the only one of you who never struck me.
 Or will we?
 We're not unemplo --
 Yes. Now.
 What?
 [singing] Mazel tov!
 I say do what it tells us. [screams and clacks claws]
 [raising claw an instant later] Maid of honor! Ohhh.
 Even in a depression, the entertainment industry thrives.
 [angry] You stay out of my dumpster!
 Yetis? Oh, Yetis.
 But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
 Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!
 What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? [He begins placing organs back in Farnsworth's body.]
 Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh! [He falls and lands against the curtain. A torch sits next to him.] Don't look at me.
 She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
 I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
 Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head.
 Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. [He pulls a large potato peeler. He prepares to "fix" Leela's problem, but she gets angry and activates the shock collar while kicking the utensil out of his grip. It flies into the groin of an upside down poster of the human body.]
 Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them. (To an intercom:) Amy, cancel my appointments.
 Thank you.
 Someone do something.
 I can't, I'm still eating. [He shovels food into his mouth and Bender attacks him by smashing his head with the shield.] Help me, Leela.
 Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help.
 Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. [He begins sucking the salt out of a salt shaker, accidentally swallows it and sneezes mucus all Leela, who becomes angry and is administered a shock.]
 Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. [His mating fin rises.]
 Ditto!
 [He is putting on eye mascara.] Hurray!
 Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
 What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. [He lays back down.]
 Oh! There he goes again.
 I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
 Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?
 [monotonously] Okay.
 A rat!
 No! Look!
 Sure. [Hermes shows him a photograph.] That's your penis!
 You're projecting an air of something.
 But how?
 I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
 Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!
 Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny! [He slurps the pills off the doctor's hand and his pupils dilate.] [high] Why always the fighting?
 [high] Clack.
 [high] Thanks for the help, Leela.
 Oh, God! I'm coming down!
 The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
 [eating] Wood!
 They took away my credit card.
 Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
 Listen to the smart robot.
 I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment.
 Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg. [he babbles rhymthically]
 Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
 Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--
 Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV.
 That was uncanny.
 I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
 So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party.
 [singing] Don't wanna talk about anything else.
 [tapping his feet] It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
 Poor Bender.
 Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
 Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
 Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!
 Hooray, robot!
 I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
 Ew, you're touching them!
 I am? At last! Recognition!
 Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
 Play that thing!
 Not if you've lived a life without regret.
 Doy!
 Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
 My slinky! [He runs over to the corner of the room and picks up a straightened slinky. He falls to his knees.] My cuddly, little pet slinky!
 J'accuse!
 You've seen me naked?
 There, little friend. Good as new.
 Believe it.
 Welcome to my life!
 [shouting] Go!
 I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. [shouting] Order the cake, damnit!
 Basically.
 I came as soon as I could. [He puts a stethoscope to Coilette's head and gasps.] It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
 [eating] I'm a doctor, she's dead.
 Gross.
 Wha?
 Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands.
 And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
 They're flying Manhattan into the Sun! [Zoidberg turns to Fry and points at the Sun with his left claw.] They must've been outta piranhas.
 Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!
 Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? [He snaps his claws.] It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! [No one reacts.] I don't hear any gasping.
 Why not?
 He may not be perfect, but do we really want some unknown new guy? I'll stick with the evil maniac I know, thank you.
 I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
 Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
 Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
 Still, to have your own pool!
 It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!
 What are you? My driver's license?
 Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!
 Amy has a point.
 Aw!
 Dios mío.
 That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
 Kill 'em both!
 We're not from around here. Hello!
 What is?!
 Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner.
 UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
 I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots.
 Really? I though you were the robot.
 Alright, alright, spare me your life story. [He turns to Bender.] Now what seems to be the trouble?
 Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine. [He turns to the rest of the staff.] [muttering] Oh boy. [quietly] I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning.
 Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
 [simultaneous] Whammy-wazzle!
 I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
 That is so unfair!
 Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free-- [The man slams the door in his face.] You didn't let me finish. I was going to say "to get the free food".
 Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
 It's the end of the line!
 Is it Planet Express, master?
 Yes, my liege!
 This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!
 A complete sangwich? [He laughs.] You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
 Oh! I have no shares! [He cries.] Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value? [His sandwich has turned green.] Please, oh, please!
 You had to drag spines into this!
 Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!
 Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! [He eats the sandwich.] Oh! I'm ruined. [He cries.] Why? Why?
 Hey, look! A fog is rolling in.
 Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
 Me?
 In fact, that's why we loved you.
 This is a witch hunt!
 [simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
 Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
 Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
 I can't spell anything with these cards.
 Finally, I have a good claw. See? [He turns his cards around.] Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
 No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
 [shouting] No!
 I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
 Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
 Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
 She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.
 It was me! I'm the hero!
 [singing] They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
 Congratulations.
 Now it's time for my song! [singing] When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--
 [over credits] Aw.
 Thank you. I made them myself.
 Goodbye.
 Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a "death sphere"?
 Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
 Still, a Parcheesi tournament.
 I found the board!
 Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
 Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--
 You kept track of it all these years!
 Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!
 By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
 Hooray! I'm helping!
 Oh, the fear!
 Bravo!
 A squid?
 Also good.
 I don't quite know how to say this. (Sobbing:) Fry is dead!
 Wait, not dead.  The other thing.
 Look out, Vegas, I've got a system. [He inserts a quarter and pulls the lever while laughing. The rolls of the machine land on "OUT OF ORDER," "OUT OF ORDER" and "NO REFUNDS."] Oh. I'm bankrupt.
 And you say these are free shovels?
 Now for a triple clam dip, with a double - [The ball smashes into his head and knocks him on his back.] OW! [He falls off the diving board and lands on the concrete surrounding the pool.] OW!
 :[He picks it up and laughs.] Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for...
 Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
 Dibs on her- ohh...
 I hate to see it come to an end. [His chip is removed and he screams in agony.] When will it end?
 Amy?
 We're gonna crash, even.
 Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!
 Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?
 Aye, what else now can go wrong?
 We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?
 I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut.
 What?
 It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit.
 Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
 Someone in trouble is!
 The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium.
 Did you see me escaping? I was all like--
 Hey, what the--
 Looks like you're retaining water.
 Why?
 At least we've got food.
 Hooray!
 Life was bad but now it's good forever!
 [reluctant] Alright, I'm coming.
 He's so talented!
 That's me, baby!
 They're hideous!
 I was all in this part! It's magic!
 Stop!
 A little land mammal!
 Oh!
 You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
 That's where I live. I have no home.
 Also Zoidberg!
 That's so beautiful!
 You stink, loser.
 [calm] I'm good! And you?
 [off-camera] He's bluffing. [A stabbing sound is heard.] Ouch!
 He's not bluffing!
 Hooray! Free sky sticks! [A lightsaber falls on Zoidberg's head, ridding him of his crust.] Ooh. [Zoidberg points his finger accusingly.] Police brutality!
 Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!
 I've got just the thing: Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. [Fry and Leela squeeze some onto their hands and rub it on themselves.] "Come one, come all," he said. "Step right up!" "This sounds too good to be true," I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. "So is it a deal?" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--
 [shouting; from elsewhere] Screw you!
 You call that an ink defense? [His coat tears off and he sprays ink everywhere and scuttles off] Goodbye, friends!
 So you wish you were never born, maybe?
 Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
 The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
 The rotting carcass of a whale.
 Clothing, delicious clothing!
 [voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
 This is wonderful!
 These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop.
 But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
 Of course I'll marry you!
 Fry?
 Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
 It was a different time.
 Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was.
 We're gonna try— What?
 Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
 I remember. I remember! [Zoidberg walks up to the table.] This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste! [Zoidberg takes his helmet off, throws it away, and eats the food.] And, with that... [Zoidberg burps.] I have closure.
 Oh, no. [Zoidberg blinks.] Something's happening! [Zoidberg looks around.] What's happening?!
 Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale.
 [repeatedly] Woob.
 Relax, friends.
 Panic, jerks!
 Ouch.
 Aw! So close.
 Hello.
 No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!
 Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
 Mmm! Lemony!
 Oh, no! [Zoidberg stands up.] My deal is doing the thing!
 I just remembered. [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] That's the guy! [Zoidberg grows unkempt, brown hair.] Oy! Now with the horror hair.
 That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much.
 Okay.
 Eh!
 Friends, I found a ten dollars!
 It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi. But the money did not. [The Professor snatches the money. Pockets it and presses the button. The blue aurora surrounds him, but not Zoidberg. Zoidberg disappears, but after a second, the door opens and he runs in again.] Friends, I found a ten dollars!
 Awwww...
 Awwww...
 Awwww...
 Stop!
 Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
 Eck!
 Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
 Land robots!
 That's a lie! I brought my own lunch today.
 We gather here every day.
 If you call that living.
 For the last time, Hermes, I didn't steal your lunch.It was Leela. She beat me to it.
 Oy, there's the problem.Jackie Jr.'s skull is blocking the doodad.Hooray! Everything's fine!
 Don't panic! We'll be okay.
 This is a job for Hermberg. You fend off the creature with kicks and farts while I un-stick you with my slippery ink.
 Is it me maybe? Aw.
 Totally, we should go on a retreat like this every year.
 Alright.
 Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
 They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
 A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
 Yeah, I know.
 Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
 Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
 Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
 Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
 I'll handle this!
 [quickly] Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! [with a normal speed] So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.
 Interesting. [furiously] Come on, men! Let's kill him!
 [angrily] Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
 My gonopores! Look it up.
 So, I guess everything worked out fine.
 Wrong, Mr. Genius.
 I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop— Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay.
 Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?
 [off camera] Wait! [on camera] I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!
 Hooray!
 Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!
 Yay!
 You won a Tony. Feh!
 Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?
 That's normal. Next patient.
 Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. [He holds up an endoscope. Fry opens his mouth.] Guess again.
 [almost simultaneous] Shotgun!
 Me next!
 Bender, old friend. What's on your face?
 Is someone talking?
 I'm ready for the countdown.
 They're missing out on some hot pickle action. [He licks his mouth flaps.]
 Or one!
 I guess we should have waited in the ship.
 [He is admiring Amy's ring] Such a stone. Is it real? [Amy pulls up Zoidberg's coat and uses the diamond to cut through Zoidberg's skin, revealing his internal organs.] Horray!
 You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
 Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
 Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
 Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... [He gobbles down the food.] ... dry woven reeds! [He eats the basket.] All gone! Can I drive?
 Wahoo!
 Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
 Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!
 Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
 Fry? Are you alright?
 No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.
 That's it over there. [He points to Fry's headless body. Fry screams.] Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.
 There.
 Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. [He lifts Fry's body up over his shoulder.] Upsy daisy!
 There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
 If you call that living.
 Hello!
 What are we going to do there?
 I'm seeing a movie with friends!
 Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. [He points to the films poster that parodies Planet Of The Apes except with Decapodians and bipedal clams riding bareback on horses.] It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
 Oh, again with the orphanarium!
 How humorous.
 Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord. [He cuts off something of Hermes] Oops.
 [with toilet paper in his mouth] Maybe he's just trying to feed his family. [ate the toilet paper]
 Can I? That's my specialty.
 [picking up an x-ray of Robot Fry] Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
 Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
 Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!
 Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops.
 Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!
 [sad] Aw.
 The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!
 No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!
 Says you, salaryman!
 Behold! The dance of peace!
 I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all.
 For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!
 My head is spinning.
 Such noises!
 And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild! [He mimes a cheering crowd. Car headlights shine in his eyes and he shields them.] What is?
 Hello! [The general winces.] So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
 [drowsy] Alright, Officer, I'll move along.
 Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
 A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!
 Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
 Are you coming onto me?
 [sexfully] I'm not hearing a no.
 Hooray!
 And in this corner, Zoidberg! [He laughs.] C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?
 Take, I've got four of them.
 Deviled egg?
 Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!
 The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
 There! Good as new!
 Oh, no! That's my-- [He gags, chokes and keels over. He gets back up again, smiling.] Gotcha!
 Why?
 [sadly] I can so relate to that.
 Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little "just friends" spooning.
 Goodnight, Hubert.
 Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. [He shakes him.] [shouting] Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
 Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
 No, I'm good.
 Zindy, my darling. I can't believe we're finally going to meet in person!
 Just in time for the "all you can stand" buffet at Chizzler!
 That is the delightful creature I've been video-dating for the past four years.
 Tonight is a dream come true! A real, live date, in a physical place that exists! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place.
 There! My home's all clean except for one part... the inside.
 Nope.
 You-do-do-do. Boy-boy-boy-boy. Greetings, merchant! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things.
 Perfect! I'll take half a bouquet of daisies, for three dollars!
 Allow... me.
 I'm gonna snip her off her feet!
 Zindy! You're even more beautiful from a distance!
 Stench... Er er er... That's probably this stinky bus station, maybe!
 Ah! Much better.
 What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.
 I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.
 I understand.
 Mhm. Can I have a refund now?
 Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.
 Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.
 I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.
 Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!
 Really?
 Hello, you!
 Thank you. The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon!
 First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming! Ouch! I forgot I was a giant crab!
 Friends! I'd like you to meet my new lady — Marianne!
 She's the best thing that ever happened to me. We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster.
 Because, my friends... she has no sense of smell!
 For the first time in my life, I'm truly happy.
 You're right! And I, as a renowned ear, nose, and blowhole doctor, could do the operation!
 I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.
 For you, my lovely rugelach.
 Such a smart one! You know everything about flowers!
 Uh... It's like summer... with a dab of vanilla and honey... or maybe winter with some gravy on it.
 Marianne, my love. I've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly... and there's a way maybe you can.
 We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant. I can give you a surgery, and when it's done... you'll be able to smell. Everything.
 True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.
 I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack. [The box is labelled "BAND-APE BANDAGES FOR MONKEYS".] It's time!
 It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have... [He sobs.] one last kiss?
 Yes. Lots. [Zoidberg starts crying.] Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.
 Then let's begin this delicate procedure.
 Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.
 I don't know how to tell you this, but...
 It's not the flowers. It's—
 But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!
 Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!
 I'd like that!
 Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
 I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
 What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
 Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.
 I can't see from down here, I can't.
 [shouting] The current! It's too much, already! Help!
 No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! [Zoidberg has many heads and sits on the steps.] Funny story: I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
 Earth: What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you. [There is silence.] Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. [shouting] On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet--
 So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--
 And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh. [He sees a hook come on from the side of the stage.] Wait, stop! I've got more!
 My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
 But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
 This I cannot deny.
 Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...
 This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink. [He puts a jar under his armpit and fills it with black ink. He dips a quill pen in and starts writing.] [thinking] Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?
 [voice-over] Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.
 [reading] Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check. [talking] Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!
 That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
 Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!
 And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.
 It's my lifelong dream.
 Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
 Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
 Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
 Is bread free?
 We'll split an order.
 [crying] I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
 It's a movie.
 Written and Xeroxed.
 Hooray!
 Bender, you said "wink, wink" out loud.
 The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
 The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
 Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
 [in movie] Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
 [in movie] The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!
 Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
 [crying] I lied.
 But you won this Golden Globe!
 This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
 What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
 No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
 What category are they on?
 That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
 And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence-- [He makes a weird noise.] ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three.
 And the winner is... [Calculon starts to stand up.] And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!
 Earthquake!
 I'm petting mine down to the bone. [He strokes a cat, causing hair to be chopped off.]
 But we're plotzing here!
 Oh!
 Oh, boy!
 What's the hold-up?
 Sure. Me.
 I know that. [Farnsworth leaves and Zoidberg picks up the bottle.] Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg! [He wiggles his mouth flaps inside the bottle and breaks off part of the ship. He screams and cuts the bottle in half.] Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! [He picks up some "Strong Force Krazy Glue" but squeezes the bottle too soon and the glue squirts all over him. He screams and steps back. He turns around and some lab equipment and a sign reading "Zoidberg: Don't Touch!" gets stuck to him.] Ow! What? Oh!
 Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. [The clock goes off and the cuckoo hits Zoidberg in the face.] Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!
 Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca. [He cries then stops.] Wait! What would the robot do? [He thinks.] Frame someone!
 I'm acting astonished.
 Fry, you scoundrel!
 [shouting] What have I done?
 Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
 Wait! Everyone must know: I broke the Professor's bottled ship. [The audience gasps.] And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! [crying] I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself. [He takes Koji's sword and rips his shirt open. More gasps.] Here I go, already. [He stabs himself but the sword crumples as it hits his shell.] Huh?
 Fry did it!
 I call entirely. [He springs up, flipping the table upside down and knocking food and beverages all over the four on the couch. He whoops and scuttles his way out of the room.]
 This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
 No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met.
 So, how did you and Colleen first meet?
 Mazel tov!
 Are you going to eat that? [He devours the bouquet in Colleen's hands.]
 Hooray, hooray.
 Hooray! We're equally good! [He is run over from behind by a ball.]
 What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
 Hooray!
 You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. [He sneezes a green mucus all over the table in front of him.]
 Ow.
 Do you validate parking?
 I can't make it! Go on without me! [Pull back to reveal he's holding onto Leela's boot.]
 Go on without me faster!
 Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! [He is attacked by a tentacle.] Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! [He is pulled through the doggy door by the tentacle.]
 Do it already! [He motions at someone.]
 Aw. [He throws up salt water fish and a duck with water into two buckets. The duck flaps it feathers and quacks.]
 You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? [The staff moves up and down and a slide whistle is heard.]
 Oh. [The staff moves down and a slide whistle is heard again.]
 We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?
 Where?
 I had a hunch.
 I know you are, but what am I? [He chuckles.]
 I love this part.
 You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. [He eats a taco.]
 Ooh! The new one's out!
 [whispering] The captain's table! What an honour!
 Brilliant!
 You can drink with me maybe?
 Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. [Bender walks through it.] Three.
 Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
 Please, sir, I love you like a father!
 All 6,000 hulls have been breached!
 They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. [Yolk drips from his mouth.] [ashamed] And eating penguin eggs.
 Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
 Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.
 Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.
 [shouting] Stop yelling at me!
 [shouting; from ship] It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!
 To the employment cave!
 You undersold it, Professor!
 Uch! In public?!
 Then we better hurry! [looking at the clock on the wall] Registration ends in one hour!
 This isn't good for Zoidberg!
 [waving] Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. [They round a corner and hear Zoidberg talking to the others through a hole in the wall.] Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
 Oh, you know!
 For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.
 There you go, dearies.
 Then good luck, sister.
 Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies.
 No.
 Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
 What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? [He shakes her.] That's not funny!
 [mesmerised] Totally.
 Damn right!
 No doubt about it.
 Help! I'm under attack!
 "Dog food", you say?
 Ow!
 Forgive me, my friend.
 [twitching] What, now?
 Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! [He jumps around.] Zoidy want go outside!
 On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
 Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. [He eats a sardine.] These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. [He eats a few more.] And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ... [He eats a few.] ... very, very juicy--
 [sexfully] I'm so into you!
 I wasn't wearing it. [ashamed] I was eating it.
 Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! [He snips at the tether with his claw but it doesn't break.] Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
 How are you doing there, Fry? [Fry blubbers.] Glad to hear it. [He picks up another fish.] Aha!
 Yum, yum, yum! [He eats it, not realising it is the top of a large pilot fish.] Uh-oh! [The fish chases him and Zoidberg woops and hides in a shell. The fish passes him and he scuttles back to Fry and Bender with the shell on his back.] Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
 Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
 Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
 What is it, Fry?
 Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!
 I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
 She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
 You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?
 Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
 No! My home! It burned down! [Hermes and Bender walk out of the ship. Zoidberg cries.] [crying] How did this happen?
 Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
 Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!
 Hello? I'll take eight!
 I watch TV with that guy!
 [singing] I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
 [shouting] Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. [Fry picks the holophonor up and plays a bad tune. A crude holo-scene forms. A crude Holo-Fry and Holo-Leela walk out of some houses and stare at each other. The audience "boos".] The music's bad and you should feel bad.
 I'll take eight!
 Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!
 Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento.
 My doctorate is in Art History.
 My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue.
 So what's in the box, already?
 In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! [He clasps his claws together.] What a day that was! [He screams and pushes Fry and Bender out of the way.] [shouting] Give me the box!
 What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? [A loud, boring sound is heard. Leela adjusts the mirror so that she can see an huge, albino (red-eyed, white) worm-looking thing.]
 If only someone could tell us more about these traditions. [He turns to the wall.]
 How about I just lay down?
 Been there, done that.
 Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to save— [A squishing noise is heard.] Aw, they killed him.
 I don't know, but it's infectious!
 Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
 Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true.
 The three coworkers I liked... all dead!
 It's funny because it's poisonous!
 So what is it, already?
 To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!
 So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?
 100!
 Where's the exploding?
 Three dollars at the drug store.
 Urgh!
 Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle. [He points to a bus.]
 Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye. [He removes the skeleton.]
 What's that enscribbled on it?
 So, what's with all the screaming?
 Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
 Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. [He takes an eel out of a bucket label "Aquarium Garbage" and wraps it around himself like a cravat.]
 Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! [He shows them.]
 Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. [He and Fry switch bodies.]
 [in Fry’s body.] Robot?
 [in Fry’s body.] Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! [He hugs Nikolai.]
 [in Fry's body.] Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. [He opens the door and looks inside.] A floor? We live like kings?
 [in Fry's body.] [He starts looking in the dishwasher, which he breaks and rips off the wall. Nikolai screams as the kitchen starts to flood.] Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box. [He rips the oven off the wall and places it where the dishwasher was. Gas starts leaking.]
 They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
 Oh, yeah, why not?
 Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
 I can't pay.
 Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
 Yes, listen to the father.
 What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
 Hello!
 There but for the grace of God.
 Excellent, excellent!
 Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. [Fry opens his mouth.] No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
 Really?
 Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... [He makes a weird noise. Fry clears his throat and tries to imitate him but fails.] What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
 That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine—
 [to Clamps, screaming] Stay off my turf!
 [off camera] Greetings, Francis. [Zoidberg walks up to Clamps. Clamps looks at him.] Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!
 [off camera] Drop the Robut. [Clamps looks to his right. Zoidberg claws five times.] I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
 My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg. [Zoidberg looks up.] [screaming] John [beep sound]-ing Zoidberg!
 [quickly, repeatedly] Oy!
 [screaming] Oy! [Zoidberg's head is almost broken.] Ow. Ow. Ow.
 That offer was for a limited time only.
 Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
 You do and I'll [beep sound]-ing gut you like a fish!
 [laughs] Classic Hermes.
 Hermes, no!
 Traitor! My friend's ample tuchus is barely out the door, and you're already schmoozing up to his replacement?
 What, you mean the remarks and the hits? That was just friend teasing.
 You don't understand. He was the only one who cared enough to insult me.
 Sure, when it's convenient. But Hermes was always there for me. And now he's gone, thanks to you, Mr. Bigshot 7-G. [He kicks Mark 7-G, starts sobbing.] I'll never see Hermes again.
 Welcome back, old friend. I missed you terribly.
 [laughs] Good old Hermes. When he stops insulting, that's when I worry.
 So, friend, welcome to my home. I'm very proud of it. But I want to hear what you think.
 [imitating Hermes] "Oh, mon, I'm Hermes, and I think it stinks in here like a green snake, or something else that's Jamaican."
 [laughs] Good one at my expense, Hermes.
 How could you even ask such a thing? Of course, I tried eating you, but your flesh was too spicy.
 Something wonderful.
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here all week.
 So, Little Hermes, are you ready to watch some brain surgery?
 Wait. I'll perform the surgery.
 It's true, old friend. My claws are too clumsy for such delicate work.
 I'll tell you what I've done. I've brought your husband back.
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here forever.
 I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
 Bupkis!
 One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
 I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
 [singing] Ain't got no cash,
 [singing] Happy!
 And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!
 [off camera] It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
 [to Professor Farnsworth] Pfff. [Zoidberg lifts up his right claw and looks at it.] Himalayan or Neptunian?
 A Tritonian Yeti?! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!
 What?
 So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture. [Zoidberg lifts up a book labelled PRINCIPLES OF ACUPUNCTURE with his right claw.] Let's begin. [Zoidberg hits Fry's right hand with the book. Fry screams.] [scared] Blood?! [casual] I mean, "Blood."
 I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice. [Zoidberg points forward with his right claw. Leela turns to that direction.] He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
 His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
 [over the noise, screaming] You may feel a slight sawing!
 And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
 Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae.
 Could you limbo before? [Zoidberg laughs.] Wait. I say, "Yes." And you say, "I couldn't limbo before." You ruined the joke, Hermes!
 There you go, Leela. Good as new!
 Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and—
 Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
 My first mission. [Zoidberg stops clawing.] I'm so excited. [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth as the camera zooms out, revealing a black-haired man to be to Professor Farnsworth's left.] And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back? [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg and smiles.] With sprinkles on?
 A very big kid.
 So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills.
 "Their wha?!" [Zoidberg laughs.] That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny? [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps. [Professor Farnsworth and Zoidberg fall in a body of purple water, where six soldiers have already fallen. Zoidberg smells the air.] What smells like methane?
 Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
 Not you, though! [Zoidberg points at the man with his right claw.] You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model! [The man sighs in relief and lies down. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth resume walking.] Funny plague, hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death.
 Super model!
 You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] It's suicidal.
 Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean—
 [touched] Friend?!
 Then you'll need someone to dissect it! [Professor Farnsworth looks back at Zoidberg.] Friend.
 Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
 I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise! [Zoidberg makes a strange sound. The Yeti grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg screams. The camera pans over to Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth covers his face with his left hand. The Yeti is crunching Zoidberg's head.] Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
 Oy. [Zoidberg takes off the stethoscope.] I lost another one.
 But, friends—
 I was just trying to—
 I'm sorry. [Zoidberg pulls a kidney out of his coat with his left claw.] I'm sorry.
 Oh, no! [Professor Farnsworth approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg shoves what appears to be a television set on the floor and leans against a table.] No! No! [Zoidberg stands up.] Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!
 Oh, no!
 You! [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] You saved my life!
 Yes, fuff. [Zoidberg stands up.] How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave? [Zoidberg shrugs.] Or maybe a butler?
 Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death.
 Alright. [Zoidberg lifts up his left claw.] Give me the knife.
 It sounds like something I would say.
 Alright, Hubert. [Zoidberg puts his right claw on Professor Farnsworth's right arm and smiles.] I swear.
 This is very difficult. [Zoidberg opens his eyes.] But I'll try... [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Friend.
 Argh! [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] You said you wanted me to kill you! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Is this one o' those "No means yes" deals?!
 As God is my witness, you can count on me. [Zoidberg points at himself with his right claw twice.] Well... See you tomorrow.
 Stop! You don't understand!
 You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
 Hubert... I'm sorry. [Zoidberg grabs a lock of white hair from the coat.] Wha?! He doesn't have hair. [Zoidberg puts the lock of white hair on a microscope and looks inside it with his left eye.] Great Little Caesar's ghost!
 [quickly] Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
 Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!
 Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
 Not too bad. [Zoidberg sits down.] Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. [Zoidberg points at Mom with his right claw.] Later, I'll show you the pictures.
 What do you want me to say? [Zoidberg shrugs.] 'E saved my life.
 But Hubert is my friend. [Zoidberg closes his eyes.] 'E's very sick. [Zoidberg opens his eyes and points at himself with his left claw.] I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... [The camera zooms in on Zoidberg's face.] From Triton!
 I live in a dumpster. [Zoidberg pulls a piece of paper out of his coat with his right claw.] All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
 [off camera] What the hell are you doing?!
 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! [We hear a growling sound. The camera zooms out, revealing Scruffy and Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth, who has grown white hair, sits up as he growls.] 'E has Yetiism. [Leela, Fry, Bender, Amy, and Hermes gasp. Zoidberg walks up to the bed.] When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
 It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti lies down.] Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! [The wheel approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg avoids the wheel and makes a strange sound. The wheel lands next to a set of logs, above which is a kettle, and its flaming tube burns it. The camera zooms in on the kettle. The water in the kettle begins evaporating.] Wow! [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti begins screaming.] Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
 Yes. [Zoidberg looks at the Yeti's head.] The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. [Zoidberg pulls a giant bolt out of his right pocket with his right claw.] Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? [Zoidberg grunts as he extracts a gland from the Yeti's head.] Ah, yes. [Zoidberg holds up the gland.] This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
 Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
 No time for an injection. [Zoidberg grabs the gland with his mouth hand, throws the giant bolt away, climbs the Professor Farnsworth Yeti, holds its head with his claws, opens its mouth with two of his mouth fingers, and spits the gland into it. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti closes its mouth, swallows the gland, and throws Zoidberg away with its left hand.] Uh! [Zoidberg hits the wall, makes a strange sound, falls on the floor, and grunts. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti grows in size.] [off camera] I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
 [sad] Nothing. Nothing at all.
 [sad] I was going to tan... [Zoidberg looks down.] Once.
 [comforted] Thank you, Hubert.
 Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.
 Packed and ready, sir.
 [whispering] They got medals.
 Money!
 A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!
 I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu.
 Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you.
 To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went! [He chuckles.] What a Valentine's Day that was!
 Goose liver? Fish eggs? [He eats it and spits it out.] Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
 I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. [He puts on a top hat.] Farewell, good sir!
 Ah! Thank you, golf slave. [He tightens his grip and cuts through the golf club.] Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless.
 What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it. [He waves his $300 around.] One art, please!
 [crying] Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece.
 So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
 Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast.
 That one grabbed his behindus!
 I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
 What?
 Hmm. [He hovers his claw over it.] Hmm.
 Leela, I would be honoured.
 Sorry, you must have been boring me.
 So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! [He cries then suddenly stops.] You were saying?
 He looks radiant!
 Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
 [sexfully] Zoidberg!
 I'm a Globetrotter!
 [washing his claws] I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery. [He laughs.] I kid! I kid!
 Scalpel. [The nurse hands him a scalpel and he cuts something inside the hick.] Blood bucket. [She hands him a bucket and he puts it under the operating table.] Priest. Next patient.
 See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.
 I'm afraid he's gone.
 Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
 That's my joke! I'll kill you!
 I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
 Enough already!
 I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
 Uh-oh. [A lobster pot traps him.] Help! Help! [He knocks on the trap. Bender wanders by, whistling.] Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!
 Yay!
 I could make the costumes.
 Gracias. [He stands up with his script behind him and walks over to the witness box where Leela is sat.] Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?
 Aha!
 [reading; unmoved] My God, he's dead.
 [cheering] Hooray!
 Shut your gills!
 Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
 [shouting] I broke your television.
 Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
 [nudging Mrs. Wong] Not bad for a city boy, huh? [Mr. Wong takes a bite of caviar.] By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar.
 [screaming] Nooo!
 Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
 Aw!
 [from inside] Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
 Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
 Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!
 The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
 We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
 Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!
 Give me that. [He lifts the weights off Fry, knocks him off the bench and takes his place. Enter Amy and Bender.] More weight!
 Enough with the questions. More weight! [The four add more weights.] More! [Amy and Fry leap onto the weights.] More!
 I'm a doctor!
 I am normal. [sexfully] Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!
 Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
 Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
 Excellent, excellent!
 You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
 I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. [sexfully] If you catch my drift.
 I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
 Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
 Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
 I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. [A tiny crustacean crawls out of the rock pool. Zoidberg picks it up.] Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
 No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. [angry] They don't!
 Same place as your species: The beach.
 How do I look?
 Then the illusion is complete.
 Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. [He jumps onto the mound and his fin pops up again. Some women walk past.] Craw!
 Craw!
 Craw?
 Craw!
 Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
 Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school? [Edna makes a questioning purr.] You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
 I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?
 Or maybe a doctor?
 [crying] No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
 [crying] You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
 Hmm, this "love" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
 Ask her to mate with me.
 But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
 Then mating.
 Is "desire to mate" a feeling?
 It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
 What? Now there's a bird involved?
 [shouting] I have no idea.
 [shouting] I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. [whispering] Fry, that doesn't make sense.
 [shouting] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
 Why would I wanna know?
 [shouting] How was your day?
 Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
 [nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
 Do I ask her to mate now?
 [reading] I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
 Oh, Edna! [reading] Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
 I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
 Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- [He sees Fry and screams. Fry manages to break away from Edna's grip and gasps for air.] [angry] Fry!
 [angry] Her caviar is on your neck!
 [angry] Fry! [His fin reappears and knocks his hat off.] I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
 A fight to the death.
 Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
 [shouting] Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
 Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species: Fatal or non-fatal?
 Large bet on myself in round one!
 I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
 Huh?
 Edna? Honey?
 Edna?
 The frenzy! [His fin disappears back into his head.] Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
 The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
 They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.
 Yes.
 Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.
 Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you. [He finishes reattaching the arm.] There! I pronounce the operation a success.
 I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.
 For you, my friend, anything.
 [from ship] Alright, alright, third time's the charm.
 We can only hope!
 [shivering] At least you're not cold-blooded!
 You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
 Huh? What's this? [His card it shaped like a lobster.] A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. [The message reads "Santa "Claws" Cousin Zoidfarb". Zoidberg chuckles.] Instead of "Claus" he writes "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
 So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
 Why?
 Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
 Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. [He pulls his hat off. Amy's and Hermes' hair is grafted to his head.] Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
 A pogo-stick!
 Aha!
 [singing] Oh.
 Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!
 [dressed as Feffernoose, singing] Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket.
 [dressed as Feffernoose] Ow!
