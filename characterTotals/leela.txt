 Instead of making the ship faster, how about installing some seat belts?
 Yes, but I feel the nafety for safety.
 That's because my bazooms don't put anyone's life in danger!
 Thank you, Scruffy.
 Never mind the ship.What about us?
 We've had it with this flying slaughterhouse. We're having it towed away for scrap, and we're getting a new, safer ship.
 Good news, everyone! Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on where they belong.Ta-da!
 No. That's the ship. The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast. And check out the interior. Note the rear-facing safety seats.
 There is no windshield. Who needs a big, breakable piece of glass when we can just monitor everything on the padded dashboard display?
 That's an arm holder.
 All right! Let's ride! Safe and sound.
 What? Huh. I guess we're here. Let's make the delivery.
 This is a delivery company. We need less adventures, not more adventures. Now come on, let's go to the ready room and wait for our next assignment.
 Ready for action, sir!
I know how to stop at a stop sign!
Professor?! What did you do to the Planet Express ship? And why are you wearing a leather lab coat?
 I understand I can still outdrive your saggy ass, even in this clunker.
Looks like you're about to lose to a minivan. Unless you have any surprise moves you've forgotten about.
 Oh, no! Like Flatland?
 Yum! Apples! Hey, how come I can't swallow? Hmm.
I knew it. I knew he'd get us killed somehow.
 Safety kills.We got to move!
Wait. What about a dimensional drift? If it went through the fourth dimension before, maybe here, it'll go through the third dimension!
 Look, up there! There's some up! The third dimension!
 That's you, Professor.
 You have a night job?
 But—
 [whispering] He's George Washington! He tends not to do that!
 He's over there, pukin' in the Bushes.
 Professor, no! [Leela and Fry run towards Professor Farnsworth and hold him. Bender runs towards George Washington's head and removes his jar from Professor Farnsworth's hands.] You can't tongue the father of our country!
 Look at the date on this newspaper. [She picks it up and reads it.] April 17th, 1775.
 Uh, ever been to Peru?
 [pushing down Hancock's musket so she can get through] I'm from Peru.
 Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin in Philadelphia?
 Bender, do you know what a chamber pot is?
 [kicking the door down] Hee-ya!
 He has so much stuff. [Leela puts a set of tableware into a seemingly bottomless purse.] He won't miss this.
 We better stop Paul Revere before—
 [in a British accent] I guess everything worked out jolly oll right, eh, guv'nor?
 [yawns] I know we're ladies-in-waiting but what are we waiting for?
 We've got to go back in toime an' set things straight! 'Urry up an' lick Washin'ton's 'ead again!
 [speaking in her normal voice] Look! All the Presidents are back! Even John Tyler!
 Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
 Yeah!
 Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
 I didn't know you could take this thing off.
 What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
 Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
 [on screen] Forget it.
 How about zero?
 Zero.
 Zero.
 One.
 One half.
 Thanks.
 Half-date.
 Half-bottle.
 Quarter-shell.
 Lieutenant Kroker!
 This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
 Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.
 We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
 What planet is this anyway?
 Fry, shut up.
 Where are all the men in your society?
 I'm already looking for apartments.
 So why did you make it your leader?
 There's no hurry.
 [ashamed] I'm afraid so.
 Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.
 Me too, meatbag.
 We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.
 We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch. [She kicks and punches the Amazonians.] Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!
 It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
 Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
 I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. [Fry hums and chops a banana onto his head.] Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. [Farnsworth pushes a button with the fing-longer.] Not too much.
 Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
 Hello? New boots!
 Yah!
 Oh, God! What have I done?
 OK, just try to be nonchalant.
 That doesn't prove I killed him.
 [from meeting room] Hi-yah!
 No! Everything's just--
 I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
 You're blackmailing me?
 OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. [She sighs.] Now to dispose of the body.
 Do you have any gum?
 Who are you?
 I've never seen you before.
 Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. [She unzips her boots and lifts her feet onto the table and twiddles her toes.] See?
 Could you get the lights on your way out?
 [eating] Lobster. Want some?
 Really?
 No.
 No!
 [crying] I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
 And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
 So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
 Good. Now let me just get the lights.
 You idiot! We already saw that.
 What is it?
 Congratulations!
 That's so plausible I can't believe it!
 How does it work?
 Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off.
 Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
 Stop him.
 No!
 Well, that's not so bad.
 Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!
 [pointing] Invaders! Possibly from space!
 Come on, Fry! Get it!
 Sure thing, Professor!
 OK. [She clears her throat.] As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.
 So my question is this: What if I found my true home? [Farnsworth pulls a lever like on a one-armed bandit and hits Leela on the head.] Ow!
 Where are we?
 Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. [She looks around the coloured landscape. A peacock open it's tail like the NBC logo.] Jeez! Apparently the phrase "tone it down" doesn't exist on this planet. [She sees Scruffy has been squashed under the steps.] Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship. [She hesitates.] Ooh! Nice boots!
 A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
 Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
 Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
 You mean that yellow brick road?
 Oh, thank you.
 Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
 Whiskey OK?
 Why did you bring us here?
 And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
 Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
 We're here to see the Professor.
 Oh, for the love of Benji!
 No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
 Uh, alright. Here I go. [She clicks her boots together three times.] There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch! [She turns into a witch, complete with pointed hat. Everyone gasps and she turns Fry, Farnsworth and Bender into frogs and laughs. Water falls on her from above and she starts to melt.] Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
 I was having the most wonderful dream. [She points at Fry, Amy and Zoidberg.] Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there.
 So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!
 There's nothing wrong with our clunker.
 No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste.
 Uch!  That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
 That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?
 No! Put that back and turn it on!
 A new eyePhone? Forget this junk. [throws out her cell phone again]
 Come on!  Let's buy some eyePhones on line!
 We are on line.
 [on screen] Hi, Fry.  Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?
 [on screen] Oh, totally.  This thing's hands-free.  [takes out a taco] That's how I can eat this taco [takes out a fork with spaghetti in another hand] and this spaghetti.
 I'm hanging up now.  [Fry and Leela touch their noses and hang up]
 You recorded that?
 [twitting] Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send.
 I unsubscribed yesterday.
 [brushing away the smell] Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?
 Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England.
 [gets out of her lounge chair] Uh, e-e-excuse me.  I have to...someplace. [takes her towel and exits]
 [hides the boil with a towel] Nothing.
 Don't look at me!  I'm a freak!
 [sighs] I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember.
 [puts a bandage on the spot where the boil was] I lance her every few months, but she always grows back. [sobs] It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated.
 Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!
 Did you delete it?
 Thanks, Fry. [sniffles] You're a good friend.
 Where?  Also, what?
 [sobbing] How could you do this?!!
 Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less.
 So my humiliation is over?
  Fry, I came to talk to you.
 It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever.
 You don't have to apologize.  In fact, I came to thank you.
 Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares.  I have nothing to hide anymore.  Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!
 Susan and I are agreed.  For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who we are.
 Come here.  [she hugs Fry but then smells something] What stinks?  Were you rolling around in New Jersey?
 Aw, you didn't have to do that.
 Don't worry.  By tomorrow, no one will remember.
 No.
 They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
 Follow me!
 It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
 Hey!
 Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you.
 I'm a woman, if that's what you mean. [The nerds gasp.] I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.
 We call it a "video game".
 Who are you?
 I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
 Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!
 Come on. We have work to do.
 No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?
 Huh? [She opens the email. The Cyclops appears on the screen.] It's him!
 It'll get there.
 After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
 Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
 Alcazar? [He leaps off the balcony and stands in front of her.] Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
 After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
 Not at all!
 There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
 Oh, please! Really?
 Fry, that's offensive to our people. [She turns to Alcazar.] Isn't it?
 Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
 It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
 I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
 Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
 Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
 It's so tragic.
 It doesn't have to.
 You're a male and I'm a female.
 Wake up, my king.
 Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?
 Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
 No.
 Look, Alcazar--
 Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.
 OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. [She looks at the table but it has been cleared.] Hey, where'd they go?
 Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. [She sits down next to him.] Who are these people?
 Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
 Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
 Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?
 Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
 I know.
 Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
 I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.
 I'll break up with him at dinner.
 I'm trying.
 Yes! I will!
 [shaking hands] Glad you could make it.
 Animals go in the corner.
 Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. [She hands him a bottle.] Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
 I ... d--
 Who's she?
 A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
 Yeah!
 But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
 Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
 If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
 Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.
 I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
 Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
 Does it really work?
 Uh, Professor...?
 I don't get it.
 I think it's moving.
 Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
 We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
 And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. [Fry looks inside the sandwich and cringes.] Nothing just gets thrown away.
 Typical 20th century attitude.
 Those things are all from the 19th century.
 Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
 That's all? But--
 Odour at magnitude 8. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 12. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 31. [The ship shakes.] We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
 Look at all this filth.
 Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
 Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. [She puts the bomb in the ground.] Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. [She presses the button and the timer changes to 15:00.] Uh, 15 minutes. [The timer changes again to 05:00.] 5 minutes. [The timer changes again to a very odd number.] "6h" minutes?
 That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
 Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
 Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
 That rat! Do something!
 But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
 [whispering] Just fire the damn thing.
 Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
 You mean the ship?
 It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.
 I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. [She shows a human shaped skull with a large beak.]
 Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.
 Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!
 Does anyone have a lighter?
 Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
 Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots. [Bender moves the boulder.] Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
 [She gets water from the pond and re-hydrates the pill. It turns into a steak.] One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. [She takes a bite.]
 Everybody grab a club. [The rest of the crew starts hitting the robot.]
 If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.
 Convenient.
 I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!
 I'm gonna miss Spencer.
 Good for you. Can we go home now? [Widnar throws a net on Leela.]
 I am...
 Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
 No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
 [voice-over; in movie] Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8. [A photo of young Farnsworth sitting reading a book on some steps in diapers appears on the screen.] And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager.
 [voice-over; in movie] After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist: Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment. [The pictures appear on a blackboard in his apartment.] For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. [There is a short video clip of the robot buying its boat. The picture changes to Farnsworth tinkering with Bender's head.] And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth.
 No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
 No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.
 What?
 Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.
 Uh, Professor?
 Yes, we know.
 Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?
 Never.
 Why, you little--
 Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
 If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.
 I'm zeroing in on him. [She sniffs.] BENGAY ... mothballs ... [She sniffs again.] ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
 There it is! The Near-Death Star!
 OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man.
 Now, they may ask for a DNA sample.
 Your Medicare dollars at work.
 Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
 Sounds nice.
 At least it keeps them from driving.
 Brace yourself for the worst.
 He's hooked up to a life-support system. [She pulls a tube off.] We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him.
 We're probably gonna make it, but we might not.
 They've blown out one of our engines!
 Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
 We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!
 All right!
 It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
 A lot of weather we're having.
 Fry, I appreciate the gallantry, but isn't this a bit much?
 [sighs] Okay. Fine.
 Aw...also, oh, Lord.
 No, this isn't mutant language. We use a lot more profanity. [The sound of falling soil is heard, and Leela falls down.] Son of a bi–[bleep]!
 I'm slipping! The one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy!
 I–ow! My leg! It's broken! How'd you get down here?
 Stop telling me to take your hand! Look, Fry, your noble things keep making things worse. Can't you just be a rude, unhelpful jerk like Bender?
 Amy, you grew up on Mars, right? Can you read Martian?
 Evacuating the planet in 3...2...
 It's not starting!
 Well, it wasn't a bad life. If only I could get back that time I spent watching Tron Legacy.
 Fry, stop trying to do things for me! [She puts her hands onto Fry's.] Whatever time we have left, just live it with me. So...you wanna join the balcony club?
 Hmmm...I've never flown a pyramid before. But I used to drive around town in a mausoleum!
 Well, the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers, so...maybe thirty-thousand.
 What?!
 Fry. The box has spoken. Go to Mars.
 [She gives back the picture to Fry.] You keep it. I'll remember you in here. [She puts her hand on her chest.]
 [gasps] How did you that?! [She opens the envelope, which contains a ticket to mars with Leela's picture on it.]
 Fry, this is the most noble thing anyone has ever done for me. [She holds somebody's arm.] Wait! Fry?
 Oh, no!
 I can't believe it. Fry sacrificed his spot for me and I never even had a chance to thank him.
 That frightened little girl in the statue reminds me of Fry! [She starts to cry.]
 But I thought your people abandoned this planet.
 I should have known better than to trust one of Fry's romantic gestures. Every time he says he loves me, I get killed!
 Fry! You noble idiot!
 Wait! Help! [The camera reveals that Leela is on a staircase in the ruins of Dick Francisco. Fry sees her.] I'm still on Mars and I can't jump!
 Or somebody else could do it!
 I don't know. Bad things happen when you say that. [She releases one of her crutches and holds out her hand. Fry is able to grab hold of Leela's hand]
 Ow!
 We're too far apart!
 Ew...kay... [She grabs her severed arm.]
 I can't be mad. I'm on way too many painkillers. Plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live! I mean, you failed...miserably...but you're the only person who loves me enough to try.
 Of course.
 Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
 I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
 I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
 I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. [She stamps the floorboards.] The floors are made of such hard wood.
 That's cute!
 I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?
 You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
 Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
 Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
 Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.
 [from outside] Fry? Are you there?
 You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
 You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
 Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
 But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
 Fry, please-- [Fry slams the door and Leela knocks.] (from outside) My ponytail's caught in the door.
 Since when do you care about us?
 Goodbye-ee!
 You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
 You did? What happened?
 It's Mom!
 That was the worst delivery ever.
 Vacation?
 Looks nice.
 Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
 Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
 It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... [She repeatedly looks at Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Fry, makes a quick decision, then pulls Fry forward.] Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
 This is it.
 Take it off or I'll break it off.
 Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
 Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--
 Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
 Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
 It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
 What? No. No! Of course not!
 But I didn't even limbo.
 Amy!
 [whispering] What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
 I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
 Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
 Nice nebula.
 Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
 What was that? [She looks over the railings and sees.] Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
 OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
 Come on, before it's too late!
 Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
 It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
 We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
 I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
 Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
 But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
 There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
 Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.
 The United States is part of the world.
 Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
 You're not registered?
 That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
 The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.
 What are you talking about?
 Bender? What happened to you?
 Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
 Bender, he's got your body!
 Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
 Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.
 Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
 I've got a better plan.
 [whispering] They give you a discount if you've been here before.
 OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
 Alright, break it up, you two!
 You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
 The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
 Yes! The system works!
 No!
 Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
 Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
 That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. [He hands them to her and she snaps it in half and looks through it like a telescope. Across the street an alien opens up Family Bros. Pizza.] I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
 Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
 I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
 No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
 [shouting] Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
 [shouting] I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
 But I've got a no-hitter going. [She sighs.] You're right. Here.
 Am I under arrest?
 The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
 You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
 Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
 Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
 All the whole numbers have been retired.
 Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
 Bender, how did you get in here?
 Since when are you my agent?
 Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?
 [reading] As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans: They're the beaniest!
 So what did you get me?
 Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
 Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
 That's a popular name today. Little "e" big "B"?
 I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
 What? Who are you?
 Oh, following in my footsteps?
 I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.
 [crying] That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
 You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.
 Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
 Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
 It's even a crummy hologram.
 So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?
 Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
 [quietly] Alright. Low and away.
 You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?
 OK. Eye off the ball.
 I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
 Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.
 I can.
 I've been training with Hank Aaron.
 I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
 [quietly] Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
 Strike one, a personal best!
 Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
 [crying] I was?
 Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all.
 Hey, kid. Catch!
 Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
 Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
 We're trying our best.
 Impressive. Who's building it?
 Say again?
 That's the only thing about being a slave!
 Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
 Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
 Yeah! Play those bongos!
 Oh, Lord!
 This society is a bunch of idiots.
 What did he say?
 Ow!
 Good riddance.
 You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
 Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
 Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
 It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! [She jumps onto a wooden statue of Bender.] Let's get a little kindling going!
 Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot "Bender"?
 No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
 Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!
 Let's blow this tomb!
 Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.
 No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument.
 [from ship] That's not Earth.
 We're pushing as hard as we can.
 [cheering] Yeah!
 Awful! Let's read some more. [reading] Dear Santa.
 Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
 Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.
 We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
 Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
 Hold it, Santa! [She nods at Bender who covers his ears and sings to himself.] Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself.
 Wait! This is what we're running from!
 I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
 Bender!
 [singing] Then you'll all work triple shifts,
 [singing] And though you're cold and sore and ugly,
 [singing] And they're made from inferior wood.
 [singing] You did the best you could,
 Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
 [shouting] Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
 It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
 Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent.
 There.
 The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
 Especially for Bender.
 Stop the execution!
 You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
 This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever.
 What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.
 Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.
 I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
 Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?
 This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
 Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
 An idea?
 Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say.
 Here!
 So what does this mean for us and our many fans?
 Let's see you beat it, Rastaman.
 What are you looking at? Is it the eye?
 Oh. Do I know you?
 Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you.
 He is so not. He's just being polite.
 No. Stop being so immature.
 It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.
 It's nice out.
 I'm in.
 Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass.
 I don't quite understand what this petition's about.
 You won't send me any spam, will you?
 Spam, spam, junk.
 No, it's a scam!
 It's a scam!
 We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.
 Hi-yah!
 How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?
 No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela.
 Nope.
 Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying "Sure, when?"
 Okay.
 Lars asked me out!
 Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it.
 What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
 Nibbler, you... You can talk?
 Blech.
 The Mona Lisa!
 Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.
 Wait .. I .. [Leela drinks]
 This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.
 Please.
 Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.
 And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.
 It's so romantic. [turns away from Lars and cries]
 It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore.
 Let's go to my place.
 [reading from a sign on the fence] "All tenants evicted, signed new owners"?
 There aren't any Pandas in New New York.
 [singing] Lars brought me candy.
 [singing] Lars says I'm dreamy.
 Hey, guess what guys!
 [singing] While we were huddled in fear, Lars popped the question!
 [hugging Lars] Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more.
 I'm OK with it.
 Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster.
 Oh, Lord.
 All aboard for Neptune!
 What are you, a whining machine? lf you want to worry about something, worry about the Yetis.
 Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies. I just got dumped.
 Santa! We forgot he's based on Neptune.
 That's it. They've gone too far. It's time to fight back.
 We're fighting back and you're helping us, you fat holiday idiot.
 So that's our proposal napkin, Mr. President. We have just enough people and ships to mount a ragtag attack.
 [singing] Now, let's fight.
 Troops, you are now equipped with the finest weapons magical elves can build. As for the battle plan...
 What?
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Does anybody mind if I take command?
 All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire!
 It's hopeless! I can't coordinate this many ships!
 Never!
 Also never!
 [Melodramatically] Nevvveeeeer!
 Nothing.
 I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy.
 No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart.
 Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today.
 Lars?
 Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?
 Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?
 Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it!
 Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me!
 Lars, no!
 [sad] I understand.
 Yeah... you were.
 That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
 That's more like it.
 We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer.
 Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
 You lousy...
 For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
 Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
 You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.
 We'll sees abouts that.
 But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
 [Grabbing Fry and shaking him senseless.] Rednecks!
 Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up.
 You shut up, too.
 Yes! Now we're inflicting.
 Buckle your sphincters.
 Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there.
 All right, fine. I admit it.
 It was only half a ball.
 Oh, thank you.
 Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be... [She is shocked.] Ow!
 Son of a... [She is shocked.] Ow!
 [She is silent for a moment, then is shocked.] Ow!
 I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of... [She is shocked.] Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn [The collar shocks her, but it goes unnoticed.] collar.
 [She reaches for the key and gets shocked.] Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?
 I don't have any god da- [Shock.] mother f- [Shock.] anger issues. [Smoke is coming from the collar.]
 [Annoyed sigh.] You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?
 I guess I would have to say, I hate you. [The collar emits a shock.]
 What? [The collar is intermittently shocking her now.]
 I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
 Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine.
 What? [ she is shocked.] Ow!
 Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. [A large shock is dispensed and Leela screams.]
 I would, but... [She is shocked.] Ow! Take my collar off.
 Ouch!
 Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
 Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?
 Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss.
 [Her collar is active during her rousing.] This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
 Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny.
 Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!
 Ow!
 Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine.
 Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
 We're trapped.
 Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. [She punches the keypad and the door opens. They get in and slam it shut before the Killbots spot them.]
 My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
 Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit.
 Oh, sorry. Nibbler!
 Ouch!
 Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
 My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. [Cut to shots of the caged Nibblonians, their poop is being harvested and transported through clear pipes.]
 Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?
 Nibbler made a bo-bo.
 So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
 Let me guess. Mom?
 Hello, there.
 I'll call him Nibbler.
 [Swings over to the top of the incline the brothers are trying to scale and slides down, boot first, at them. She kicks them and then slides across the icy floor. The collar is emitting a shock.] Ooh. That feels good.
 My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world.
 Oh, Lord.
 Does that mean they only do 60% of the work you do or that they actually do more work because they're only 60% as lazy?
 [whispering] Remember: Don't show any reaction to his appearance.
 Shhh!
 I just like having the end locker. It's not like Amy cares about it at all. But no, she won't trade with me.
 Yes! She is a rat!
 Bender! How could you be so lazy and irresponsible?
 Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!
 Crisis averted. Without alcohol, the Benders are dying off!
 Things really worked out nicely this time.
 How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!
 I guess this is a... Not so bad. As long as we don't need to use our mental... Mental...
 Wha?
 For your looks? [Leela laughs.] Nice one.
 [whispering] Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
 Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
 Um ... a grey-ish blob?
 Um ... a grey-ish blob?
 A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?
 I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
 Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic. [She takes a forkful of flowers from the middle of the table.] So fresh.
 Are you kidding me?
 You're charging us? After you blinded me?
 And hard-working.
 I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
 I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
 I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
 I'm taking evasive action.
 Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration.
 Eyesight is for chumps.
 Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say "Turn Master Steering Wheel Company" say "Nibbler"? Oh, no!
 [on screen] I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control.
 The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
 You'll never get away with this.
 I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!
 [whispering] That guy sounds familiar.
 Bender!
 I've got an idea. Hold still. [She rubs her ropes against Bender's arm.] It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
 [cheering] Alright!
 Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off.
 I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off. [Bender rubs some sweat off his head with Nibbler. Leela focuses. The shape turns into Farnsworth.] Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
 Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
 Since when are you performing at children's parties?
 Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here.
 He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
 And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
 [shouting; from outside] We demand Bender!
 As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
 Yeah!
 [singing] Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
 Blernsday Night Blernsball!
 What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
 Why won't it start?
 Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
 Whale oil. [She points to a barrel of Mobil Dick Whale Oil.] Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
 Come on!
 Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
 Kinda cool.
 It got ruined in the wash.
 Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
 This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
 They're beautiful.
 We're home.
 Rock it, Bender!
 And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
 Quick, grab his footcups.
 Bummer.
 Guidance system?
 Autopilot?
 Dark matter indicator?
 All systems operational. Let's rock!
 Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
 Sabotage. [Gasps all around. Leela points to an L-shaped piece of metal on the table.] This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.
 And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
 Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
 My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
 Surveillance?
 Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
 Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
 So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.
 Bender, you've gotta help us.
 Eh, it's fine.
 No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
 It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
 You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
 No, you can't!
 I don't know which I'm more: Enraged or disgusted.
 Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
 No, they don't.
 I'm worried about him too, Professor.
 What do you mean "a scam"?
 That is so unbelievably manipulative.
 Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
 OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
 Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.
 [whispering] OK, is everyone ready?
 [shouting] Coilette, you she-devil! [The crowd gasps.] You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
 Hi-yah!
 I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
 Aw!
 What did you say?
 What's the mission?
 What are we delivering?
 We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
 If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
 What for?
 But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
 What?
 Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
 That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
 [reluctantly] Yes.
 [reluctantly] Yes.
 Zapp Brannigan.
 Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.
 Zapp?
 I never loved you.
 What do you want?
 You don't know how to do any of those things.
 Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
 I said "very nice work".
 OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
 They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
 I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
 What the hell happened?
 I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
 No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.
 Just get to work.
 Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
 On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
 You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
 But, didn't I do a good job?
 Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
 Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? [They shake their heads and she puts the folded sheet on top of a pile.] He ran out of beer? [They shake their heads again.] So he's about to kill us?
 Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. [The look ahead as they get closer to the planet.] We're gonna crash!
 OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
 Even if I make you work hard?
 Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
 Just do it.
 Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
 You did it! You actually did it!
 Well, actually--
 Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.
 No.
 Oh, alright.
 Let's mutiny!
 If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice.
 What the hell's a common cold?
 I never heard you mention that.
 Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?
 Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!
 Ah! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Ow! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Oh!
 Where's that chicken soup we asked for?
 Professor, no!
 Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine.
 No. But theirs are!
 Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113. [Leela looks at Fry and removes her right hand from the device as she turns to him.] I actually knew that offhand. [Leela puts her right hand back on the device as she turns to it.] I'm Facebooking right now.
 This is the exact location of the dump. [Leela turns to her left.] But there's nothing here.
 [screaming, off camera] I found a satellite!
 You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you.
 Hi-yah!
 No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
 Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it. [The phone rings. Leela answers.] Hello?
 No, he didn't.
 Completely out of ice?
 Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
 You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?
 Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. [She holds up a bottle of beer.] Would you do it for a Bender snack?
 Gotcha!
 We all figured that out.
 Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
 Why are you cheering, Fry? You're not rich!
 [groans] Let's just find Bender.
 Bender, you can't even vote. You're a convicted felon!
 But Nixon's the worst president in history. And alternate history! The rest of you aren't voting for him, are you?
 Well, I think we can do better. This year, I'm going to get involved in the political process and make my voice heard.
 Hello? I'd like to volunteer. Is anyone lurking?
 Hey, stop that. [She turns on the lights, revealing that the man with the hammer is actually Senator Travers.] Senator Travers? That's no way to win an election.
 No, don't quit. You have great ideas. You just need to get them out there with social media. Look, I posted your debate video on Facebag. [She shows him a video of his debate on her Wristlojackimator.]
 Absolutely. We just need to conceal your intelligence and honesty in a hipper, dumber package.
 He won the nomination! We the people did it!
 Thanks, guys, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. If we're going to win the election, we've all got to get involved.
 Okay, let's nip this Earther movement in the bud by releasing your earth certificate. Where were you born?
 Patriotism, good! Where is it?
 Cradle of humanity!
 Why are you rednecks doing this?
 What's wrong with you? Why are you sabotaging a decent, honest candidate?
 [groans] What a bunch of xenophobes. It's time to find Senator Travers' earth certificate and put an end to this nonsense. Who wants to help me break into the hospital in Kenya?
 You? Why?
 Shh! It's a herd of night watchmen.
 [gasps] I found it! [She goes over the folder.] I don't understand. There's no earth certificate in here.
 [reading through the folder] Wait a second. There's no Earth certificate, but it does say your mother was admitted to the maternity ward...this morning!
 This is crazy! You're from the future?
 But why would it be so important to stop Nixon?
 It's not too late. You can still win the election.
 But you will have one in just a few hours. And everyone will know it's real, cause we'll broadcast your birth on live TV!
 Back, please! She needs room.
 Not you. The camerawoman needs room!
 He did it! He did it!
 Congratulations, Mr. President. [She shakes Travers' hand.]
 Aw, thanks. Now, get up to that podium and change the world.
 What? How can you say that?
 At least we tried to make a difference by supporting Senator...Senator... What was his name again?
 What do you think of the view Fry?
 Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
 It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
 Except for the word "blern" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
 Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
 Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
 Yep.
 Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
 This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
 Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
 OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
 Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
 Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
 Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
 There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
 No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
 I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
 OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
 We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
 Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
 Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
 Robot...we be.
 Then we'll go with that data file.
 Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. [An alarm sounds. Hundreds of robots come out of doors from all sides towards Fry and Leela. Another alarm. The robots clear the area.] So far, so good.
 Have you seen this robot?
 Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
 Robot's don't have bathrooms.
 Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
 Hurry up Fry.
 I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
 Quick! Let's duck in here!
 Mine's not working!
 OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
 What's that?
 Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
 Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
 Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.
 Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
 Are you alright?
 Who are you?
 What's going on here?
 He'll do it. He's crazy!
 Of course.
 I'm awake, I'm awake!
 Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?
 I'm lowering the platform. You ready to come up?
 Hello? Hello?
 I'm not sure. I think he's shuffling off sadly into the distance.
 Hey, I'm here. That's got to count for something.
 Us? Why do we have to go?
 Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -
 We're not murdering anyone, Bender.
 I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
 Yes.
 [off camera] Huh. Buggalo tots?
 What exactly are those made of?
 I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
 Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
 Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it.
 Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market.
 This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
 Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
 Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
 You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
 Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
 They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth.
 Should we turn on the TV?
 Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy.
 Ugh!
 Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
 That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
 Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—
 Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
 Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
 Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
 Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it.
 Please! Just a few days.
 Thank you, Angus.
 Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
 Okay! That's it! I need some air.
 Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?
 Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
 Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
 You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion.
 Why, Major McZongo? Why?
 But why did you attack me?
 Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing.
 You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from.
 Eh... Make it two.
 [over credits] An' a small whisky. Large.
 I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
 Bender, what's wrong?
 You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever. [She puts the back of her hand against his head and it sizzles. She pulls it away quickly.] Ow!
 Hey, what's rattling around in there?
 Fry, are you alright?
 Ooh, look at that!
 Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
 Hey, what's behind that door?
 Is it the secret ingredient?
 I was just curious because of the armed guards.
 What are you doing?
 No. That's moronic.
 Bender, why did you jump in?
 Where are we?
 Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
 This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
 No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
 It varies from person to person.
 [whispering] Quick.
 It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
 Blech!
 Fry! [Fry realises what he is doing and spits the Slurm out and breathes a sigh of relief. Then he drinks some more.] Fry!
 That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
 [pointing] The exit! We made it.
 You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!
 How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
 Fry, untie us, quick!
 You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
 Yeah, we're boned.
 Hurry!
 We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
 She's gaining on us.
 For Slurms!
 Ugh! Fry! That's disgusting!
 You double-dipped! Geez.
 Fry, quiet. Oktoberfest is a classy celebration of how far humans have evolved. You need to be on your best behavior.
 Sit up straight! The countess Von Luftballon is watching.
 You just say that because you're primitive. People in your day were backwards and crude.
 Fry! You're embarrassing us!
 Okay, that's it. You are a boorish, primitive Neanderthal!,?poem>
 Yes. And I've had enough! I'm breaking up with you!
 And keep your stupid chicken hat, too!
 [sobbing]I ate Fry! I broke up with my boyfriend and then I ate him!
 The pain and guilt are too much! I can't go on knowing what I've done! (Belches, smacks) (Wailing): Oh, Fry!
 Can you really remove all my memories of Fry?
 He thought he recognized one of the monkeys! What was I crying about?
 Good morning! Geez, who died?
 I don't know how Bender and I do all this work by ourselves. Maybe we should hire a delivery boy.
 It's...it's something about the color.
 I don't know. I should be happy. Bender's sausage just won third place.
 Do something!
 Then how are they unmanned?
 I guess it's just me and you, chicken hat.
 What do you Neanderthals want?
 Orange?
 I have to admit, your version is more fun.
 But the movie--
 This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
 Second.
 I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?
 Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
 That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
 Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
 Oh, Lord!
 Fry, we're worried about Planet Express.
 You've changed, Fry.
 I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
 Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
 Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
 They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
 Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!
 Hell, yeah!
 Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
 It's the Parade Day parade.
 Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
 Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!
 Oh, Lord.
 How is Lynn, by the way?
 Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts.
 Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
 Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
 How are you, Fry?
 Are you okay? What just happened?
 Space pirates!
 You know. Pirates, but in space.
 Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
 That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
 It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
 I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever.
 Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.
 Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us.
 [shouting] Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that "huddled over for warmth" crap.
 Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
 How long have you been at it?
 Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
 Not really.
 Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
 Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
 Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
 This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
 Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
 Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
 Ow! Hey, watch it!
 If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
 Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
 Did he use his tongue?
 Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
 Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
 We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
 Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
 But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
 Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
 This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
 What are you doing to my ship?
 Amen.
 And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called "sleaze".
 Uh, here.
 Hey, great idea!
 Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
 Go nuts.
 What in hell happened to Bender?
 Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
 Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
 [singing] It's up to us to rescue him.
 [singing] It's us who tempted him to sin.
 [singing] Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
 Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
 Wait. What fiddle contest?
 [whispering] Do you know how to play the fiddle?
 [whispering] No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. [talking] What happens if we lose?
 We'll do it.
 Time for the drum solo!
 Hurry, Bender!
 Oh, sorry.
 Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
 I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
 We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
 Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.
 Ah, that must be my old boss.
 I know.
 But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
 [shouting] Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
 Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
 I can explain--
 [whispering] What is this, high school?
 What?
 Co-pilot? Under who?
 That drunk?
 Bender, what happened to you?
 You and Morgan were having an affair?
 Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
 Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
 Come on. I have a better idea.
 Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
 While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
 OK.
 Where is it?
 We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. [She takes something of her wrist machine and puts it in the tube.] Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.
 This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
 But how did you know we were here?
 That's only four minutes from now.
 [singing] They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
 What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
 Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
 Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
 He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
 We've all talked it over and--
 Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
 No, Fry, by "close quarters" I mean this office--
 And by "people" I mean you!
 And by "inconsiderate" I mean--
 We sure are cheerful this morning.
 What happened to you?
 Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
 Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
 What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
 At least it's got a great view.
 Wow! Now this is fantastic!
 Was his apartment rent-controlled?
 Wow. This is beautiful.
 It's not crap.
 Happy housewarming, Fry! [Fry stares blankly at Leela's gift.] It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
 You had cable. This is satellite.
 Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
 Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
 Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
 Bender? [He turns around and she gasps.] My God, you're a mess!
 Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
 Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
 Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
 Well, if that would work.
 Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
 I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
 Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
 He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
 Bender! Stop!
 Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
 You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
 Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. [Fry and Bender stare blankly.] Fry's the one who should be-- [Fry and Bender keep staring.] Oh, never mind!
 I say me.
 I say yes.
 I say yes again.
 But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
 Creeped out.
 [stepping into the ship] Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
 You hold on to it. [kisses him] I'll be back soon.
 Liftoff!
 Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting. [presses a button and a hologram of the sphere comes up]  Activating the Force.
 [whispering] We better whisper.
 Look.  What are those huge letters?
 This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
 Holy cr—
 Firing pocket rocket!
 I hope this is the control stick!
 Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!
 We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?
 No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
 Uh, I suppose so.
 You will? [turns to reveal she's already covered] Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later.
 What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
 [as Zapp walks away] If you see any steaks, that'd be good!
 So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
 Thank you.  [takes them and eats them]
 Bummer.
 So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
 Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate.
 It is?
 Did that snake say, "Hello"?
 Zapp?  Where are you? [to herself] Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him.
 We do not.  And you can't talk.
 I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
 That's so sweet.
 No! [sobs] Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe! [cries]
 Maybe —[sniffles] Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.
 Like the tuba.
 Only without the tuba.
 It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
 Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree. [reaches out her hand] The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples! [one falls down on her head] Ow! [she catches it with her hand] Wow! [she takes a bite and looks at Zapp seductively] Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.
 Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.  [eats the apple] Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, I—I couldn't think straight. [resumes kissing Zapp] I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me. [has a thought] Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second! [pulls away from Zapp's embrace]
 So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
 Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration. [suddenly realizes] Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!
 Then why didn't you give me any?
 So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
 It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.  [realizes again] Oh, dear God!
 You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
 I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed! [realizes] The ship's fully functional, isn't it?
 So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead! [sits down on the log and sobs]
 Fry! [they hug] But how did you find this planet? [looks at Zapp menacingly] Well?
 But I saw Earth explode!
 You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
 Yes.  I believe you.
 We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series of—
 Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team.
 [sighs and pushes Zapp to an area where they can make love] Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!
 [unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
 [shouting] Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
 We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
 Thank God!
 You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!
 Oh, lots of reasons.
 You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
 OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
 [sexfully] Fry, this is for you.
 Oh, for God's sake!
 Wait! Take me first!
 Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
 You did it, Fry.
 Thanks for saving us, Fry.
 Now, hang on.  Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?
 No, it's not!  There's precious life right here in this scum puddle.  [He holds up a desert muck leech.]
 Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.] Get off me! [She throws it to the ground.]
 No, don't kill it! We have to...
 No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost. [The leech then bites her eye and she screams.] You freaking slime wad!  [She pulls is off her eye and stomps on it, then stops.] No. I killed it. It was the last of its kind.  [The creature comes back to life and bites onto her knee.] Let go of me, you...  [She holds her leg up and fries the leech with a laser from her Wristlomojacker.]  Poor thing.
 Fry, calm down and stop braining.
 You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head.
 It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. [They stand up and show their badges that say "WOMAN."]
 That doesn't seem fair.
 But that's the best shot of the day!
 Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?
 What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
 But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
 Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf.
 It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
 That beautiful violet star?
 There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?
 It's you and me, ponytail. [He cracks her pony tail like a whip.]
 We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948.
 I'd like to see him try.
 Look out, Agnew!
 Is... is he okay?
 Let me give you a hand.
 That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans...
 Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action.
 I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
 Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
 Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
 Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!
 It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
 Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot.
 Zoidberg?
 Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly.
 Shh! I'm a fugitive.
 I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about...
 Goodbye, sweet goofbag.
 You go, gorilla !
 This is sub-commander L., with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot. [The leech snarls against the glass of its case.] I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated. [The Feministas in the background cheer.] Again, confusing. Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
 Previously, on Futurama.
 It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
 Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
 Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
 You mean something like, "The best defense is a good fence?"
 I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout.
 Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.
 But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong. [She walks over to a phone booth and tries to open the door. The camera pans down and reveals Frida's body is blocking the door.]  Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!
 Your dad? Nixon?
 No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling. [They all scream.] So just stay calm while I call Fry.
 What message?
 [She gasps.]So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
 Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?
 I, I, uh... I think I read about it.
 [She is heard through a speaker on the Nimbus.] I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
 Psst. Are you alone?
 Fry, you traitor!
 Okay. One, two... [Her boots are pulled to the magnet. She screams and Fry laughs, but he is grabbed by the ears and pulled along with her. The Planet Express ship takes off with the Nimbus chasing after it.]
 [She throws him in the go-go cage.] I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.
 They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
 The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
 Start to close? Are you out of your...
 We made it!
 Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
 Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
 But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
 You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I...
 [She gasps.] The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
 The violet dwarf star!
 Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
 Bender?
 Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.]
 It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
 Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
 May it please the Court... [Judge Dogg slams his gavel.] I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle.
 These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then...
 Okay, okay. Shut up, already.
 Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us.
 [She gets light headed and has to sit down on a bed.] Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
 I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite.
 You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
 You are one devious bastard.
 What about the sentries?
 Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.
 What's Plan C?
 We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall.
 [She enters the bridge.] Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! [She looks at Scruffy] Uh...
 You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
 I could kiss you, Professor.
 Put your hands in the air!
 That's optional.
 Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all. [She begins to cut the wire for the plunger.]
 What is really going on?
 Then why should I trust you? Why?
 You're you. That's all I need to know.
 Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-
 Ew!
 The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
 And white rhinos.
 This is unbelievable. What's going on?
 Like what?
 Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!
 Hey, you know what might be a hoot?
 Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
 Except that.
 Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?
 Keep your palms flat.
 Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.
 Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
 It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
 Let's search the web. [They both look around. Leela points.] Over there.
 Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?
 Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
 She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
 Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?
 But Fry's our friend, Bender.
 You stifle, Bender.
 Although he is completely right.
 We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!
 She asked first.
 Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot.
 Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!
 Fry?
 Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?
 And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
 Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots.
 Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!
 And don't eat it.
 Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
 Don't yell at Nibbler like that. [She picks him up.] You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.
 I said pet him.
 Are you alright?
 Not you. [She picks up Nibbler and looks in his mouth.] Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
 No!
 Next time I'm keeping it.
 Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
 Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
 Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
 Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
 Bender, what's going-- [She gasps when she sees Nibbler disappear.] [crying] No!
 [crying] Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
 [crying] You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
 You do?
 [crying] I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
 I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
 Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
 I'm not mopey. You shut up!
 Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
 A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
 [theatrical happiness] Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
 Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
 You're right. I feel terrible.
 I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
 There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
 What is it?
 OK, check the guidebook.
 Wait, what's that?
 Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
 [crying] He was so cute.
 [shouting] Nibbler?
 It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
 [simultaneous] Idiot.
 [shouting] Mutants!
 Mutants! They're real!
 No, we're on the top.
 Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.
 [shouting] Nibbler?
 El Chupanibre? What's that?
 Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
 You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
 [raising her hand] I volunteer.
 Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
 Bender, do something.
 I can't. I love every living creature.
 As a friend.
 Well, I could use a new tank top.
 A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
 Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
 You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
 You did it!
 And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
 You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. [She stands up and heads for the door.] [shouting] So long, jerkwads!
 It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
 Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.
 Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room.
 OK.
 No!
 [shouting] Stop!
 Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
 Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
 Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
 [on screen] Say again. You're breaking up!
 This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
 OK. I was just at this part: Yah!
 Grab on!
 And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
 Wow, this is all so confusing.
 Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
 To motherhood.
 It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
 If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
 Amy!
 There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
 [off camera] Hey, Fry! [Leela enters.] Pizza goin' out. Come on!
 I do love a man in uniform. [Fry clears his throat, laying emphasis on his delivery-boy uniform.] I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants.
 That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?
 So... You're a Robot?
 [off camera] Oops.
 I can't make out a thing!
 Just deliver the package and let's get outta here.
 Oh! You're the chef, are you? [Leela stands up.] Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?
 Awful. We had nothing to say to each other. [Leela sits down.] So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours.
 Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!
 Really?
 Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...
 I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
 In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.
 Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
 [crying] It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.
 I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
 I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
 That's not even close to what I had in mind.
 I know. [They both look up at the stars.] Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
 Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
 Punishment?
 Who said that? How do you know my real name?
 I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
 Great Cheech's ghost!
 It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
 And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
 It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
 It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
 [shivering] Oh, I'm scared! [She strokes her ponytail.] My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
 Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
 [shouting] Don't worry! I'll be fine! [She looks down again.] [talking] They know something about me and I've got to find out what. [She swan dives off the ladder, into the sewage. She appears to emerge as a mutant with an octopus head. She takes the octopus off and looks at her reflection.] The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
 Eurgh! [She throws the octopus back into the sewage, turns and sees the hooded figures. She gasps.] Who the hell are you?
 Where did they go?
 Ew!
 Hands up! [One hooded figure puts it's hands up.] Tentacles too!
 What is all this? [She points to the wall with all her pictures on it.] Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
 [angry] And what about this [She pulls a bracelet off one of them. She compares it to her own.] How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
 Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
 They killed my parents!
 They are my parents.
 What does it say?
 So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
 [crying] You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. [They hug.] This is the happiest moment of my life.
 Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?
 Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!
 No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend.
 Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?
 My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
 I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
 Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
 Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor.
 I don't believe that story for a second.
 Huh? Hey! Quit it! [She leaps up.] Hi-yah!
 How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
 Fry, shut up and look at this! [reading] May cause superpowers in humans.
 Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?
 Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
 Yes, sir! [They run back.] Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?
 Ain't got that.
 Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities.
 To have parents.
 Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
 It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
 We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
 [shouting] Listen up, New New York: There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're--
 [shouting] Sorry! [whispering] A new era of justice has begun.
 Clobberella!
 Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
 Especially from everybody.
 For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.
 Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
 Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
 Sh!
 Well, so long. Keep in touch.
 Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!
 You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!
 Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
 I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! [The clock strikes 10.] Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume! [Enter Morris and Munda. Leela gasps.] There they are!
 You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
 Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity.
 No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!
 Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
 Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.
 I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
 Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
 No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance.
 Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.
 In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here. [She rips off her costume, revealing her normal clothes. Morris and Munda stare.] It was brisk, I dressed in layers.
 Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
 Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
 Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.
 Mom! Dad!
 Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
 Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?
 We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
 Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.
 Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.
 Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright.
 OK, then. Grab it!
 Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!
 Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas.
 No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.
 I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
 OK.
 Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War. [She points to a plaque that says "Sith Invasion of 2865 Historic Site"]
 Let’s hear the rest.
 Company! Attack!
 I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect.
 Are not!
 Says who?
 Violent outbursts.
 I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork.
 Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat.
 [Shoving Hermes outside] Get out of my office!
 Okay. Just filing alphabetically. [She unscrews the container] A, B, C, D... [The message is in AL1.] Oh, this requires a little extra thought. [She looks around then hides the message behind a potted plant] I'm a natural.
 Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
 [As Hermes shovels the last of the paperwork into a furnace.] You make it look so easy.
 This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
 You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. [They gaze across the table into each other's eyes. Without averting his gaze, Doug slips out a long pink tongue and licks up the mint.] Ew!
 I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
 There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
 Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
 I don't know. Maybe?
 What? How can you tell?
 There's no such thing.
 That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
 Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
 Animals?
 Wait! What about the animals?
 Yes, but what about the animals?
 The animals.
 So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
 Do you mind?
 Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
 [from ship] ...maybe a snappy dresser.
 Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
 Uh-huh!
 They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
 He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
 No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
 Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
 Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
 [flattered] You don't mean that!
 Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
 We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
 Wait! What's wrong?
 But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
 This doesn't make any sense.
 Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
 Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
 Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
 I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
 Captain--
 If we could speak seriously for a moment--
 I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
 What?
 I'm not really in the mood.
 Can I please just go back to prison?
 Much rather! [Zapp starts to cry.] What are you doing?
 No. And it's pronounced "sham-pane".
 It's not a big deal.
 Oh, forget it.
 It comes with the job.
 Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
 Uh, listen, Zapp.
 Zapp, last night was a mistake.
 No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
 The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
 Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
 Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
 Eurgh!
 [defensively] Nothing.
 [defensively] We just talked, OK?!
 Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
 Hello, there. [The animal sniffs around Leela's feet.] Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
 No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. [She picks the thing up.] Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
 I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
 Good. That's the last species.
 Nibbler!
 Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
 Prepare for lift-off. [She turns the key in the ignition but the engine doesn't start. The fuel gauge reads empty.] We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
 No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
 [defensively] Nothing. We just talked.
 That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
 Alright, alright. I'll call him. [She presses a button and the videophone comes down.] I mean, if living is that important to you.
 [on screen] Hello, Zapp?
 Zapp, we're out of fuel...
 [on screen] ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
 [on screen] Bird's don't crawl.
 Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
 [sexfully] Please?
 [sexfully; on screen] Big Z?
 I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
 Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
 I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
 His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little-- [The ship shakes again.] Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
 We made it! [She looks through a pair of binoculars.] And some of the animals survived.
 [thinking] Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
 Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
 Check!
 Oh, you have got to be kidding! [Farnsworth shocks her with a cattle prod.] Ow! I-I mean, "Aww! That's so sweet!" [He shocks her again.] Ow! I mean, "Aww dat's show shweet!"
 Yeah, sure.
 Does that dummy have a brother?
 Perhaps. What's your point?
 Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
 I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
 What was that?
 Bender! [Bender panics.] What's going on in here? [She gasps.] Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
 Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
 Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.
 Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
 Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
 Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?
 Uh, no.
 Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?
 Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
 [reading] Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!
 Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
 Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
 Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
 I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you.
 Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
 Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
 The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard. [whispering] She's nuts!
 Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--
 Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain.
 This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
 Now, here's the plan.
 Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
 I'm willing to take that risk.
 OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. [The carbonated logic matrix looks like several fizzy drinks cans. She opens one of them and grunts.] I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.
 Fat chance.
 Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
 Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
 Only a few more. [She pops another one.] Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
 Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead! [Fry takes in a last puff of air and connects his oxygen supply to Leela's mask.] What was that?
 Last one!
 It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry! [She looks over and sees his lifeless body.] Fry? [She sees her oxygen supply is at zero and her face mask is connected to Fry's tank and gasps.] You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! [She turns him over and tries to resuscitate him. He coughs and spits out a candy heart. It sticks to her cheek. She takes it off.] [reading] You leave me breathless. [Fry smiles.] [talking] Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.
 Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
 Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
 If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers.
 What the hell are you supposed to be?
 [While eating a soft pretzel.] They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
 Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes.
 Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy. [Bender can be heard laughing.] But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd.
 I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake.
 Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?
 Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?
 No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
 Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
 He messed up my hair.
 You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
 Oh, lord! Now what?
 Do what I say. Tell her!
 Fine. Hurry up.
 Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this.
 Fry! [She starts crying.]
 Good night, dumb prince.
 The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
 Fry, you're alive!
 [She kisses Fry on the cheek.] Good ending. Not great.
 Where's the Professor?
 That poor, incompetent crew. [Leela puts her right hand on both Professor Farnsworth's hands.] What do you think happened, Professor?
 That's ridiculous. [Leela turns to her right and crosses her arms.] The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
 Or we could fly around it.
 You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time.
 Or die trying.
 Hang on. [Leela points at the statue with her left hand.] It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
 The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass! [Leela hits the green Alien's chest with her right index finger.] I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
 We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
 Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
 There. See? It was no big thing.
 Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
 We'd better investigate. [There is thunder.] Looks like an Ion Storm, though. [Leela turns to her right.] Everyone suit up!
 Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry. [The camera zooms out, revealing a table with three hamburgers, three soda cups, and two chip packages on it.] The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!
 Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish. [The space whale opens its mouth.] It's a space mammal.
 I did it! I outran 'im!
 Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth.
 Correction: Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
 That won't stop me! [The lights go back on. Leela stands up.] Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that "Möbius Dick".
 Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law. [Leela points at herself with her left hand.] I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to.
 There's nothing personal about this! [Leela points at Fry with her right hand.] That thing screwed up my delivery! This time, [musical sting] it's business!
 Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale.
 Fear not the space behemoth. [Leela turns back to her right.] In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all.
 That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!
 [off camera] Use boaty talk!
 Alright. [Fry, Zoidberg, Hermes, Bender, and Amy look at Leela.] Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?
 Miss Wong, you have the 'poon.
 You know, I'm not sure. [Leela turns to her left. The four-dimensional space whale, which is seen through the window, continues flying.] I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them.
 [off camera] Don't worry.
 I'll drop the anchor.
 Negative, Sailor Moon. [Leela lets go of the anchor.] We're goin' for a sleigh ride.
 Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying.
 That's it! [Leela stands up.] I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man and—
 Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah! [Leela kicks Hermes away. Hermes grunts. Leela pulls a knife out of her right boot with her right hand. Amy, Fry, and Bender turn to Leela.] [off camera] You're all too weak! [on camera] I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew! [Leela grabs the helmet on her chair, puts it on, and points at herself twice with her knife.] Understood? [in a different tone] You've gone mad, Captain. [in her regular tone] That's enough outta me! [Leela takes two steps forward.] Now come on! I gotta find that whale. [The four-dimensional space whale eats the part of the Planet Express ship where Hermes, Amy, Fry, and Bender are standing.] I found 'im! [Leela runs to what is now the edge of the Planet Express ship, jumps towards the four-dimensional space whale, passes her knife to her left hand, and screams.] With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee. [Leela lands on the four-dimensional space whale and stabs it six times, grunting.] You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?
 Where are we?
 For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!
 Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand.] Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand again.] Also, what and how?!
 It's a great mammal! [Leela points at the wall to her right.] See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier. [Leela looks to her left.] Wait. [Leela turns to her left.] Who said that?
 Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?
 Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
 [whispering] Mammal.
 Oh! [Leela grunts.] What are these things?! [Leela fights off the tentacles.] Get away!
 How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
 [angry] I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale! [The camera zooms out, revealing that Leela's flesh has melded with that of the four-dimensional space whale.] [calm] See?
 Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale.
 At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale.
 Shut up, Zoidberg!
 You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my [echoing] delivery!
 Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!
 I should've listened to my crew. [Leela turns to the four-dimensional space whale.] That space whale wasn't a monster. [Leela turns to the others.] It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
 On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?
 In what field?
 They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.
 You went to college?
 Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
 Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
 You won't last two weeks.
 I think that's probably your roommate.
 So what makes Guenter talk?
 What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
 Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
 Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
 That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
 But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
 So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
 Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is...
 I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
 I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
 Oops.
 Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. [She holds out the hat and banana and they take them.] We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
 Wait, what's that sound?
 No! No!
 [shouting] Not there.
 [shouting] Help us, Guenter!
 Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
 Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while.
 Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then.
 Wow! You're good!
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
 She gave her life to save mine!
 Nice!
 Hey, Professor, couldn't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over?
 Fry? [Leela opens the top of the clam shell revealing a stunning ring with 15 diamonds on it.] Wow!
 AAAAAAHHHH!!!
 Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
 So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
 Um, alright.
 They're so lifeless-like.
 [reading] See through the eyes of a bender unit. [talking] Fine.
 Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her.
 The toaster's not working right either.
 Ow! Ow!
 Look out!
 Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
 Hey!
 [defeated] Zoidberg.
 Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
 Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
 Leela bring fire?
 Never heard of it.
 Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
 Yah!
 I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
 Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor.
 Hiyah! Hah! Ho-ho! Heeyah! Amy, quit using my punching bag for golf ball target practice. It's all lumpy.
 I didn't bend your golf club. And the next time I don't bend it, it'll be over your head.
 Enough, you two. It just so happens that I also planted a spy camera to catch Amy using my punching bag.
 You were living in my punching bag?
 I thought it was one of Hermes' exotic lunches!
 I'm sorry.I just get really hungry about 11:30. That's not an excuse. It's just an explanation of what happened.
 Who are you?
 The ship's lost power!
 Me, neither. It really could have come in handy, like, 50 times.
 All life support has shut down!
 The monster won't even know the ship has a basement. Unless you posted it on Facebook. Like the last secret I told you.
 What was that? Amy, run!
 Now will you run?
 I got the steering wheel. Leela and Amy! A winning combination.
 Hiyah! Yah! Yah!
 I've got navigation. We're on our way home.
 Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.
 And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.
 We're not buying it this time.
 It's time we solved this problem the old-fashioned way. By shooting it.
 Quick, in here. We're the only ones left who can trust each other. I know you well enough that no creature could ever fool me. No matter how much it looked like you.
 But I'm just so scared. Kiss me.
 Sorry.
 Is that a cooking show?
 Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
 I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
 Among other things.
 Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
 What's this spice for?
 Oh, that's ridiculous! (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
 Hey, have you seen Fry?
 What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
 Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
 Uh, Professor--
 [whispering] Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
 [shouting] Oh, dear God!
 OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
 Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
 So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
 That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
 Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
 [whispering] Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
 You see Emperor Plon here? [She points at a painting.] He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
 Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
 No. One week.
 Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
 You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
 No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
 That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
 I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
 That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
 I'll accept.
 [on screen] I like you.
 [on screen] I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
 What are you talking about?
 Of course I'm alive.
 Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
 I know. Amy, get the bottle.
 Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
 How we doing, Amy?
 It's crunch time. Let's do this. [The Professors gives Amy, who is in a Robotic suit, the envolope, Amy gives it to Leela, and Leela sighs.] It's for you, Professor.
 We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?
 We're a delivery company!
 An airline!
 We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.
 Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
 That's discriminatory!
 Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.
 But the ship is dirty.
 But that was my idea!
 There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.
 You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
 Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!
 We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
 Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society.
 It's nice.
 I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
 Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.
 My girls!
 How industrious!
 What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!
 I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible.
 What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company.
 And it is requested.
 Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
 My girls are back!
 And that's that.
 Aw!
 Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
 I asked you five minutes ago.
 Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
 Why can't you accept his help?
 But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
 Oh, sorry.
 Professor, we have no power.
 I'd better light some candles.
 Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?
 Great! Now we're being crushed.
 Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
 Fry, can we talk about our relationship?
 I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again.
 But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?
 Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look: Don't you ever wonder about the future?
 I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start.
 What?
 Goodbye, Fry.
 Knock knock.
 Of course.
 Thanks. Hi, everybody.
 Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things.
 You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me: If Fry an' I ended up together—
 Gimme that!
 Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. [She pulls the dipstick out of the ship and looks at it.] [shouting] We're OK on Coke syrup.
 You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
 Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!
 What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
 So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
 [echoing] Can do!
 Look! A starling!
 Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.
 That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.
 It's that jerk from the truck stop! [Sal leans against a barrier munching a sandwich.] Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
 Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles. [Fry tears off his shirt à la Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons revealing what definitely are muscles.] Ooh!
 I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?
 Why did you do all that stuff?
 What is it? Is it about Bender?
 And Bender?
 You do?
 Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
 Stay here.
 So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
 [sexfully] I'll think of something.
 [opening the door] I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished.
 I'm thinking of having a window installed.
 Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
 A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it.
 I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
 Oh, Fry! I love what you've become.
 What is it?
 Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
 You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 What's happened to you?
 What? Why would you do that?
 Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
 I don't know.
 Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous.
 So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?
 I thought circusitis only affected children.
 How is that? [The Professor zaps with the prod and she screams.]
 Is everybody in position?
 Okay, good. On three. One.
 Two.
 Three.
 I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
 Honestly, that went better than I expected.
 That's Amy's sweatshirt!
 Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality.
 [Fry and Leela can be heard groaning] Bender, be careful!
 Not in Space Massachusetts.
 I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
 Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
 OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--
 Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.
 Hermes, who were you yelling at?
 You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
 Bender! Romance isn't about money.
 For your information, it's because he's hideous.
 Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
 You'll be back to zero soon enough.
 Fry--
 I think you're over reacting.
 Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
 This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
 So, how's business?
 Yeah, it's pathetic alright! [She whistles. Bender hums.] How much?
 Done.
 No!
 You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
 Bender's in his office.
 Nice ass, ass.
 [whispering] Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
 Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.
 Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
 Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
 Oh, I do.
 So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
 Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
 Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
 No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
 Yeah.
 Good to see you.
 [whispering] Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
 Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
 Bender, do you know who that was?
 No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
 This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
 When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.
 [voice-over] My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
 But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
 What do you mean? Watch this!
 That's it. I'll take you on right now.
 I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
 Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
 Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back. [The Clearcutter drags him away from her, drills something and slams him back down again. There is now a hole in Bender's head.] Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
 Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
 I said "us".
 No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?
 I don't know. But I'm not helping.
 Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
 According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
 Keep laughing, Fnog! [And he does. He walks back to his corner.] Ready, Bender?
 OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog? [There is nothing but an antenna in Fnog's corner.] Hmm.
 So, once more we meet again.
 You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
 [ironic] Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
 Yes!
 I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
 Brace for emergency landing!
 Bender, shut the hell up!
 Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see— [gasps]
 [getting out of her coffin] Leela?
 [walking towards her duplicate] How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
 [grabbing her twin's tank top straps] No, you "Shut up! We gotta get outta here!"
 It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
 Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?
 I have to go!  This is just too freaky! [she exits the room out the door]
 Wrong again.  You were right.
 Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too. [kisses him] As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor—
 Oh, back off, missy!
 Shoot her!  She's the robot!
 We just told you!
 My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.
 I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
 The cyclops eater!
 [singing] Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,
 One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander.
 [off camera] Holy matrimony! [on camera] That's one flashy rock!
 I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
 Good?
 I'm still listenin', you big lug.
 You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
 I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
 Oh, Fry!
 Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!
 [off camera] What's that?! [on camera] Is my eye playing trick on me?! [Fry gasps.] It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours.
 Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.
 [sexfully] Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare.
 [sexfully] Hey, Fry.
 An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
 It's like staring into the face of God!
 I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
 [back to normal] Team assembled! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth.] What is that box, you old witch?
 [off camera] The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi.
 [on camera] I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
 Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace.
 Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of.
 [off camera] Zoidberg, [on camera] stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!
 Until then...
 [shouting] Fry, get up here! It's starting!
 Oh!
 I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks. [She indicates the clocks on the floor.] Let's get back home.
 Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
 Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing.
 Not if I can help it! [The engines cut out.] Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
 Alright, here's the plan: Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
 Have you seen today's news?
 No, over here! [She points at the headline.] [reading] Flying saucer captured!
 No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
 Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here. [She turns to Fry.] Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
 Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him. [She approaches a salesman.] Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?
 [whispering] It's the 20th century, Professor.
 I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
 Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
 Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
 Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?
 Snap out of it!
 Hi-yah! [She kicks the other pathologist.] Yah! [Truman peers over the edge of the table and she kicks him.] Yah!
 Don't you need this one?
 Anything?
 Good afternoon, sir. [Fry is impressed with what he sees. Leela turns around. She has one huge eye in the middle of her face. Fry screams.] Name?
 I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
 As long as it's not about my eye.
 Is it about my eye?
 Just ask the question.
 I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
 No, I just work here.
 Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
 I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
 Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
 Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
 ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
 Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
 Your permanent career assignment.
 Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
 Then you'll be fired--
 Out of a cannon into the Sun!
 Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. [She points at a poster of a man wearing a hardhat with the caption "You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do".] You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
 Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! [She jumps at Fry, misses, and falls into a cryogenic freezer. It sets itself for 1000 years.] You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
 Two, three-- Hey!
 Shut up, Terry.
 Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
 This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
 Hmm. [She looks around and sees Fry and Bender hiding behind a shelf in amongst other assorted heads.] I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
 It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! [Fry backs away and hits a shelf with the heads of US presidents on it.] Watch it!
 Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
 Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
 No-one makes fun of my nose.
 You guys were totally out of control.
 [from outside] Open up!
 Wait!
 Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
 I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
 Quitting.
 Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
 Hey! He stole my ring!
 I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
 Can't we get away in the ship?
 I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
 Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
 One!
 Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
 Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake. [quietly] Although you wouldn't know it from looking.
 There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer.
 Bender raises a good point: Where is Fry?
 Someone should tell him.
 Nothing.
 I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
 Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
 Wait. What's that?
 Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
 That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
 Whoa! You guys have issues.
 Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
 Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating.
 Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
 Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
 Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
 Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.
 Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
 Aw... I'm sure it's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster. Blech!
 Oh, my God. It's Randy!
 I hope she used protection.
 You're doing the right thing.
 You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
 What?! It's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard!
 Don't you lay a hand on that angel!
 You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.
 I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.
 Bender! She's a sweet little girl!
 Ohhhhh!
 Bender! Stop!
 Uh, maybe I should drive.
 For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?
 Plus, you have the high beams on!
 Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor.
 No! No! It's tasted human blood!
 Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
 OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!
 Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
 When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--
 It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
 No! I want the real teen experience: Chores, curfew, the works!
 Dad! I'm underage!
 Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.
 Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.
 No, I'm not!
 What are you, on a diet?
 Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.
 Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?
 A tapeworm!
 Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!
 Alright!
 I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
 Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.
 My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?
 It is. I know it is.
 [whispering] Bring beer.
 OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.
 There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
 It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
 I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
 No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
 Until she sneaks out!
 According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.
 Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
 Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.
 We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
 Zoidberg is dead!
 Oh, no! [The kids revert to foetuses in goo. Bender reverts to a CD of Bending Unit Blueprints.] Quick! Get them into the fountain!
 Well, you could bother me a little.
 I'm coming in after you!
 I think I might be a couple years younger.
 He's too far out! We can't reach him!
 Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.
 With friends like you guys--
 And I'm really happy I have that life back.
 [cheering] Yeah!
 Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
 No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.
 It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
 Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?
 It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. [She gasps.] The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!
 Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy. [Nibbler grumbles. A truck can be heard backing up and Leela enters the room, driving a fork-lift.]
 Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn.
 One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They press buttons on their glasses and they refill by themselves. They drink again.]
 [At the table with Nibbler.] Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle. [She pinches his cheek.]
 A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
 Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?
 If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit.
 Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. [They laugh.]
 [She is kneeling before the cat.] Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. [Nibbler crouches and hisses like a cat.]
 Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? [The hypnotized crew stop and looks at Nibbler.]
 Granted, schnookums. [Nibbler climbs into Leela's lap and settles.]
 Nice!
 Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
 How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on.
 It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
 Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.
 I'm in!
 Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off.
 Hi. I'm Leela.
 It is pretty sickening.
 Nothing would revolt me more.
 That's great.
 Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!
 What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
 Really?
 That's not really a career. More of a felony.
 Can I wipe it off first?
 Professor!
 Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away.
 Kif's dead, Bender.
 Whack the bottle!
 Mutilation is never easy.
 Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life.
 The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. [She pulls a pink, multi-level cake out from under the table, points to her eye and blinks.]
 [She sighs and pulls out a pair of LED glasses that have two eyes on the front. She uses them to wink at the two jailers.] Hang on a second.
 I'm trying! [She struggles to pull him, but slowly does.]
 Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!
 Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed.
 [She pulls the guns away from him.] Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
 No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
 Amy?
 Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! [Amy, Hermes, Farnsworth and Wernstrom go through the door while Leela holds off the pursuing tentacles.]
 [She examines the invention.] Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes.
 It got the professor!
 Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
 It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. [They hug.]
 Zapp?
 Bender, we need a place to hide!
 Sorry.
 We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
 Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
 Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula.
 No, it can't be. [The lights flick on.]
 I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
 I love the tentacle. [She turns a little to reveal a tentacles is in her neck.]
 [She stands up.] Hey, Yivo, feel this.
 People of everywhere, I have shocking news.
 Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing...
 ...is mating with you! [The congregation murmurs to each other. She pulls out and holds up the sample she used.] These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
 Wait. I didn't agree to...
 Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
 This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious.
 Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
 Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze.
 [She sighs.] You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you.
 Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen.
 And we were in love.
 Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
 And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
 But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
 Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
 Protestors?
 Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
 At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission.
 This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.
 This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
 [standing up] Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
 Get ready!
 When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?
 Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
 That's adorable!
 Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
 [on TV] I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.
 Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
 Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
 Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? [She runs her finger over a penguin's black feathers.] And clean the black parts too.
 Has anyone seen Bender? [shouting] Bender? [She pats her knee.] Here robot, robot, robot.
 Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
 I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
 No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
 Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
 How ultra?
 Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
 What is it? We'll do anything.
 You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
 Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.
 [crying] Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
 Hey, you're enjoying this.
 I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
 Yeah ... that is fun.
 Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. [She looks down the gunsight.] But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. [She shakes as she starts to squeeze the trigger. A tear streams down her face. She shoots and the penguins squawk and run away.] [crying] Oh, no! What have I done? [She runs down the hillside. The penguins are gathered around a dead penguin. Leela falls to her knees and cries.] Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? [Bender opens his eyes and resets to Human Mode. He loads the human language and brings up his task list. 1] Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
 Aw! They love you!
 Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
 Not this way.
 Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.
 No!
 They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
 Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
 Phew!
 It's Fry!
 Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
 Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?
 There's no time for that! The Professor needs us!
 Uh, Fry, you're glowing like the Human Torch on prom night.
 I better take that. [Leela takes the baby out of the cup and holds it in her hand and smiles as the crew looks at it.] Aw, he's so cute. [Looks again.]  Wait, no he isn't.
 It's okay, Bender. No one here will laugh at you for not knowing where robot babies come from.
 Relax, Bender. No one would let you near a child. Bev will get custody and you'll be a deadbeat dad who never even bothers to know his own son.
 I know so. You're absolutely horrible in every way.
  Bender, I was wrong.  You're a fine parent and I want to apologi—
 [whispering to Smitty] He's really a very good father.
 I'm amazed someone who dispenses such warm soda could be so cold-hearted! [takes out a quarter] I'm gonna buy a drink just so I can throw it in your face! [Bev dispenses a cup of Slurm, but not before delivering something else. Leela gasps and takes it out.] It's another soda baby!
 You got knocked up by a police officer while he was looking for your kidnapped child?!
 Should we call child services?
 It's too foggy! We can't navigate through this storm! Our lights aren't bright enough.
 [patting her pockets] I must've left them onboard.
 Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
 What did I do?
 We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
 No, we can get jobs.
 Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
 Career chips. [She holds one up.] You remember? They assign you the job you're best at. [Fry stares blankly.] I tried to give you one and you ran away. [No response.] It's how we met!
 Just give me your hand.
 Baby! [She clips herself.] Ow!
 I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
 Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
 Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
 Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener. [Fry and Bender laugh.] Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
 It's only been 23 minutes.
 Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
 Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
 Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
 Oh, uh, hey, Fry!
 [sitting down] Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
 Fry, thank God we found you.
 It's not the year 4000.
 But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
 Exactly, you're in L.A.
 Could one of you guys get that?
 It's a doorbell baby! [She crouches down to the bundle of blankets in the basket. Fry and Bender appears behind her.] Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--
 Bender, stop! It's a baby!
 Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in.
 No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.
 How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
 Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
 Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. [An old man approaches her from behind. He is dressed in a grey suit and is wearing a grade 135 badge. He clears his throat and Leela turns around.] Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
 You used to say that all the time!
 Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
 That's me over in Cootietown.
 That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
 Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
 And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain.
 Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
 Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
 Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!
 Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service.
 Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
 A tall doctor, you say?
 You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
 Me? Perfectly normal?
 Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
 You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! [She stands up.] I'm getting the surgery.
 Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
 I did it! I blunk!
 Hooray!
 I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
 Oh. That's so handsome of you.
 What are you saying?
 Sure!
 You're just jealous!
 Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
 Actually, most doctors are rich.
 That sounds wonderful.
 Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
 Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
 Oh, Adlai, stop!
 That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
 Us? Me? You? Kids?
 Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
 Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
 Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
 I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
 Kind of fatty.
 Uh, um.
 Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
 Oh, they're all so adorable.
 Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
 I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
 Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
 Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
 She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
 Damn right I was!
 Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
 Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
 Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.
 Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.
 He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through. [She puts Nibbler down and takes a whole joint out of the bag.] Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. [Nibbler doesn't move.] Roll over. Roll over for the ham. [Nibbler chirps and licks his leg and arm.] You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
 The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad is a toad, almost the size of the sheep. It stares at them and it's eyes oscillate and buzz. The sheep walk in single file into the pen and one closes the gate behind it. The judges confer and the Hypno-Toad turns around and hypnotises them. They stare at it, open-mouthed and raise "10" cards. The crowd cheers. Leela stands at the side of the ring and puts Nibbler into it.] Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!
 Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. [He doesn't.] He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!
 Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
 Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
 Why is that good news?
 That's Earth. [Fry stares blankly.] The planet we live on.
 [shouting] No! Nibbler, come back!
 Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. [She sees a blue glow coming from a dumpster at the end of the alley.] Nibbler? [She walks closer to it.] Nibbler, you're scaring me. [The lid flips open and one of the brains comes out. Leela screams. She runs away and it chases her. Two more join it and she rolls under a fence. The brains bump into it. She sees Nibbler at the other end of the alley. He is dressed in a blue flight suit and is pulling a tiny spaceship out of a little shed. She gasps.] Nibbler? [He looks at her and climbs into the spaceship. There is a small hole in the roof for his third eye to go into.] Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? [Nibbler takes off and waves goodbye. The brains fly over the fence and Leela gasps.] [shouting] Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. [Nibbler lands. Leela hurries into the ship and it blasts off again, knocking the brains out of the way. The ship flies around the Planet Express building and up into space.] Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
 This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk. [Nibbler chatters.] Wait! I understood that! [He chatters again.] You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain. [He says something else.] You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? [He says something else.] Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe? [Nibbler says something that sounds like "yes".] So, how did the universe begin? [Nibbler tells her.] Then the meaning of existence-- [Nibbler acknowledges.] So every religion is wrong!
 I'm not afraid.
 So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
 Oh, you're all so cute!
 Aww!
 So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
 Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
 Now, when you say "special"...
 Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
 Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
 You can count on me.
 I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
 This! You for this!
 No! [She runs over to it and puts her hand in the flame.] Ow! Fire hot.
 Brain. Brain make people dumb.
 You go fight biggest brain of all.
 [shrugging] I 'unno!
 Duh...
 Icky!
 Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
 Fry, don't die! Wake up! [He dies.] [screaming] Nooo!
 Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties.
 Time for a diap-y change!
 Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
 The sun, the sea air, good friends.
 Bender!
 I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
 OK.
 Aha! [She throws the harpoon and starts pulling it in.] Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
 Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
 Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! [She pulls out another boot with Zoidberg on the end of it and groans.] Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
 Come on, let's go home.
 Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
 It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
 Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
 We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
 You did it, Fry!
 There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
 OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
 Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
 Sure she did.
 I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
 [whispering] Ocean madness.
 Where's Fry?
 It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
 But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?
 The magician?
 But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.
 Whatever.
 Prepare for launch.
 It's you!
 Fry, are you alright? What happened?
 Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
 Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
 Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--
 But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt. [muttering] I couldn't believe it. I was really...
 Me? Really?
 Is it part of the opera?
 But it's so beautiful.
 Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool. [She looks into his eyes and holds his hands then quickly takes hers away.] They're so cold.
 Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
 [shouting] What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
 [shouting] What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
 Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
 Yay, Fry!
 Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling? [Amy opens a box of "Emotion Flashcards" and takes out one of the hardhat guy crying.] Ah!
 Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
 What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
 Whatever you said, forget it!
 Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--
 I can't stand it! [She takes a deep breath.] OK. You can have my hand.
 I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
 Whoa!
 [singing] Fry, you do not understand.
 [singing] I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,
 What?
 [singing] That isn't what I meant,
 [reading] I'll give you my hand...
 and  [singing] In marriage.
 Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
 Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty.
 My God! Saint James was a robot!
 Sure, why not?
 Where is the great fountain?
 Just tell us, already!
 But, Professor...
 Why? [She is pulled under by the Professor. A hooded figure selling Gelato notices and follows them.]
 This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?
 [shouting] Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.
 [shouting] Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to: I can't go out tonight because... [The shaking stops but Leela still shouts.] I have sweaty boot rash.
 Right. If they try to look in the box.
 That oughta keep those dopes occupied. [She stands up and pulls a sheet off something.] I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
 Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek. [She sighs.] I need coffee. [She walks to the coffee machine and is about to put the coin in but looks back at the box.] OK, heads I look, tails I don't. [She flips the coin and covers it. She lifts her hand and smiles.] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. [She lifts the lid off the box and puts her head inside.] Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
 Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
 Y'know, let's just say it's heads.
 So, what you think you just explained to us is that--
 Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
 What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?
 [singing] On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,
 Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes.
 It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
 Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong.
 Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun.
 Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state.
 Oh, Lord, not Robanukah.
 [singing] To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
 Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty.
 Setting Bachman turners to overdrive.
 Forty kilometers. Fifty!
 One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
 What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this "junkyard Golem" can celebrate Robanukah.
 LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way.
 I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass? [Bender buzzes some more.] Okay, if we survive.
 They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us! [The bees fly in circles and crash, exploding when they hit something.] That was weird. It's like the Jägermeister air show all over again.
 [She scrapes beeswax into a jar.] Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship.
 You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
 What is it?
 [reading] 0101100101. [talking] What does it mean?
 Bender, what happened?
 I think Bender may be telling the truth.
 Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. [She drops a newspaper onto the table. The headline "Hit And Run" dominates the front page.] There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
 That's crazy!
 There. No rampaging for you tonight.
 Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
 Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
 [shouting] Fry, stay back!
 Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
 It was very sweet of you, Bender.
 Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
 Cursed, got it.
 The tracks lead here.
 Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful: Many robots are stupid and violent.
 We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
 So what happened to Project Satan?
 You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
 It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? [It growls feebly.] Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
 Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
 Oh, no! It's midnight.
 Fry, distract him.
 Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
 Whoa!
 Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
 That's not necessary.
 Please stop.
 I really would like you to stop singing.
 Yes, please.
 [angry] Where have you—? [calm] Nah, it's fine.
 I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once. [She cleans her mouth with a napkin.] Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap.
 Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
 Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
 Really?
 Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
 Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
 Fry went to the party?
 Fry stood me up and died? [angry] I'm so angry. [sad] I mean, I'm so sad. [angry] But I'm still pretty angry. [sad] But also sad. [to Hermes] Can I be both?
 Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
 [voice-over] Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life.
 Actually, you're on time.
 I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
 That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
 Hey, Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode.
 Sounds like your kinda place, Fry. Wanna go?
 But, Bender, you are--
 Ooh, ancient Wall Street.
 Do you know what it means?
 What were they used for?
 Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
 [reading] Tokens only. [talking] How does this work?
 What's this? [She sniffs.] Another bathroom?
 Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton.
 It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
 Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?
 Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?
 You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.
 Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!
 It's beautiful.
 Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?
 That's kinda pathetic.
 Not me.
 Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
 OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
 OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
 What is it? [She gasps.] My God! Did you hear maracas?
 Then it wasn't space bandidos. [She turns around.] Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape.
 How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
 No.
 Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
 OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
 [whispering] Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
 Aha!
 Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
 Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
 He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
 [whispering] Downplay the tiara.
 200,000?
 But, Mr. Barker--
 Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
 Get him!
 I don't know which one to shoot.
 Alright, enough of this. [She shoots a display of model planets hanging from the ceiling and they fall and knock Bender and Flexo to the floor. Another planet bounces onto one of the doors, revealing the atom. Gasps all around. Bender sits up. The atom is in his chest cabinet.] There's the atom!
 I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--
 It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--
 Wait, you're making a-- [Some flowers are handed to her.] Ooh! Look at that. [A woman puts the tiara on her head.] I feel like a princess!
 I almost had that tiara.
 Fry, that's a radiator.
 How'd you do, Fry?
 Hmm.
 I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
 Well, someone's in a good mode.
 Sure. I'll do it.
 Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing.
 No.
 Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
 The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A.
 He seemed nice.
 And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
 How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
 Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen.
 Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
 Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.
 You went there this morning for doughnuts.
 It will be in a couple hours.
 They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
 [reading] Philip Fry, the original Martian.
 Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
 Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?
 Shh.
 Shut up!
 Well, that was disturbing.
 Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?
 Really?
 Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot.
 [Being led outside.] What's gonna happen to me?
 Thanks, Colonel.
 Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole. [She pauses as her parents look shocked.] I'm sorry.
 Urgh!
 These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this.
 What are you doing here?
 How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
 You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim.
 Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface.
 [She sighs.] Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose.
 Fry? What are you doing.
 Wait, I never meant for you to... [Fry jumps into the mutagenic lake.] Oh, no! [Time Lapse. She is rowing a boat to where Fry is.] Fry! Fry! No! No! [She reaches in and pulls something out. Fry has become a blob. He has grown an extra eye and tentacles.]
 [She starts to scream but stops and vomits into the lake.] Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed.
 Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants.
 Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss. [Fry puckers up.] Hug. [Fry opens his arms.] Handshake. [Fry sticks out a hand.] I'll text ya.
 Who's ready to fight for equality? [The crowd cheers.] The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!
 Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface.
 Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March.
 The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children. [Softly. To Raoul.] That so we have something to give up at the negotiations.
 Mom, why have I never heard this?
 Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now.
 Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work.
 Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
 But it's so round, so hideously round.
 Oh. So you only care about my looks?
 What?
 You'd be stupid to try.
 Professor, what's the matter.
 Oh, lord.
 At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things.
 We could always switch back, right? [Amy grins.]
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Not exactly. [Fry makes a revolted sound.] Aha! You do only like me for my body.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Leela. Amy?
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] [She put a hand over her right eye.] Fry?
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] [She gags.] Not at all. [The door opens. Amy has made Leela's body overweight. She unwraps some butter and eats it.] Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Would not!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] It's on.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Ew!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] No, it only makes you more attractive. [She spits her dentures into her wine glass. Everyone watching groans again.]
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] You mean, like my penis? [Fry gags and a worm comes out of his mouth.] Eh!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] No, you're disgusted by me!
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Prove it! [They start making out while the other restaurant goers scream. Pan over to Amy, in Hermes' body, watching them. The ice cream she is about to eat falls onto the table.]
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] That was nice.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body.
 [in Farnsworth’s body.] Wow! How did you do it.
 Dinner ready?
 Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
 Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
 Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.
 No.
 Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
 No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
 [chewing; on radio] Roger!
 We haven't thought of a name yet.
 We can't call them that.
 It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?
 Good idea.
 Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
 [shouting] What do you people want?
 You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?
 Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
 I'll go get some more bricks.
 Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.
 Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
 Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
 No!
 Sorry, babies.
 I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say "mama".
 [shouting] Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
 Hey, cut it out!
 [on TV] I am.
 [on TV] That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
 [on TV] Come on, say "mama".
 [on TV] Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong...
 [on TV] I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
 [on TV] But eating an intelligent animal is different.
 [on TV] Stop it!
 Eck!
 That's stupid!
 This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers. [She points at Fry.] You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun. [She points at Bender who stares blankly back at her.] You both should be in here instead of me.
 Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?
 It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
 You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another.
 Go consummate yourself.
 Please! I just paid off my car!
 [mumbling] Yeah, it is.
 Thank you, Jrrr. [She kisses him.] I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.
 Whoop!
 Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
 Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
 Oh, OK.
 Pass the blowhole.
 Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
 Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
 Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
 Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
 Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!
 Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
 Talk to me.
 If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
 Ooh! Let me feel. [She and Fry sit next to Bender. She puts her ear to his chest.] Have you thought about what to name it?
 You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
 [simultaneous] That's good!
 Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
 Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
 We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
 And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
 You're doing great!
 Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?
 Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
 [reading] Death by airlock failure.
 [reading] Death by brain parasite.
 [reading] Death by sonic diarrhoea?
 Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
 Ow!
 Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
 Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
 Nowhere special. The moon.
 Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
 Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
 OK, we're here!
 Relax. It's open till 9.
 Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
 OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
 We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
 Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. [The other three high-five.] Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
 Who buys this trash?
 What's wrong, Fry?
 But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
 Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
 Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
 [singing] And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
 Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
 Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
 OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
 Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
 That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
 No. Now we're gonna die.
 Thank God!
 Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
 Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
 I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
 Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
 Bender?
 Hang on. Hang on. Jump! [The trio jump over the bridge and the buggy drives under it. They land back in the car. The Crushinator slams into it and cuts her way through. They come to a gorge.] Hold on to your helmet!
 Nightfall's coming. [The shadow falls over Fry and he starts to shiver.] Hurry, before we freeze.
 We can't outrun it forever.
 Quick, get in.
 Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust. [The shadow creeps over Fry and his smile fades.] Now get in here before you freeze.
 Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
 That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
 A week would be a little much.
 Fry, look. [Fry and Leela gaze at a stunning Earthrise]. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
 Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
 [from lander] So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
 We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
 Delivery for... [Leela looks at the envelope on the package.] Francis X. Clampazzo?
 Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding.
 How was the wedding, Bender?
 Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said.
 Oh, Lord.
 Hello.
 Oh! You know who could help with that?! [Leela looks at the others. Zoidberg walks up to Leela and Sheriff Burley and claws three times.] Francis!
 Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot—
 Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork! [to Billy West] Could you bend it back for me? Billy?
 [to Fry, whispering] Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
 No!
 [happy, screaming] So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
 Not if you stand on their air hose much longer.
 No way!
 I insult you, you fat sack.
 [in shower] Fry, could you come in here and help me rub on this new scented body oil?
 Why? Says who?
 We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
 That doesn't sound so dangerous.
 It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys.
 Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
 Now, bees communicate by dancing.
 So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
 Bender, quick! Waggle something!
 Relax. Everything'll be fine.
 There's the black box.
 Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static.
 We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
 Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
 Look! [A small bee floats towards them on the jelly.] It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--
 I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
 This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
 [shouting] Good luck, Bender!
 Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
 Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
 You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. [There is no response.] [alarmed] Fry?! [Fry is hunched over on the floor, clutching where the sting hit him. Leela gasps.] He's... he's dead!
 [crying] It was all my fault! He died because of me!
 [softly crying] They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. [She picks up a box marked "Memories of Fry" and takes out a collectible spoon from when he was the Trisolian Emperor. She dips it into the jar and eats the honey and begins to become a little light-hearted.] Mmm... It's good. [She eats some more and stops crying.] I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
 Fry? I thought you were dead.
 Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
 It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
 What?
 Wake up? But I'm not--
 In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
 Well, here goes.
 Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
 You took this from Fry's locker?
 That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
 Is this some sort of brain scanner?
 Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
 What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
 But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
 Are you saying I'm going crazy?
 Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
 Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you.
 Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before.
 Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
 No, no! Don't say that! This is real!
 Not another dream! [She gasps and drops the sheets from around her. She is wearing Fry's jacket.] Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
 Fry's alive! I have proof!
 But he gave me his jacket. Look.
 But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
 [squeezing] I am not under stress, damnit!
 What?
 Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
 I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
 One spoonful to calm me down. [She swallows it and falls over.] OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. [She eats another one but nothing happens.] Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. [She swipes at the jar with the spoon but misses and knocks the royal jelly onto the sofa.] Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge. [The jelly forms a Fry-shaped object.] Fry? [She rubs her eye.] Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
 Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
 Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
 What? What do you mean?
 Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!
 Pooh!
 I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.
 Uh, were you just singing?
 I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
 OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.
 What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
 Stop it! Stop it!
 OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it. [She looks at a photo of Fry on her bedside.] The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you. [She takes the jar of honey.] Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever. [She starts to eat.] One. Two [She dips in a third time.] Here goes. Goodbye, waking world.
 [crying] Then what am I s'posed to do?
 [crying] I can't!
 OK. I'll try. [The bee buzzes past her again. She waves her arm around.] Go away!
 [crying] I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do.
 [crying] I don't understand what you mean!
 Fry. You're alive!
 Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. [She looks around.] Where am I?
 But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
 Really? How long was I out?
 It got through, Fry. [She hugs him.] It got through.
 [whispering; over credits] You could really use a shower.
 Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects.
 Well, if it'll help Fry—
 It wasn't unavoidable! [Leela jumps forward.] You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, "Stop! You're cutting my spine!"
 Whoa! Whoa!
 [continued] Whoa!
 It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor.
 We've had it with Zoidberg! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth with her right hand and pokes him in the chest three times.] We demand you fire him!
 Is he blackmailing you somehow?
 [off camera] Zoidberg... [The camera pans over to Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Fry, who have just entered. Amy and Bender enter. Fry crosses his arms.] [on camera] I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again.
 What are you doing there?
 Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
 Zoidberg, we were wrong! [The door opens.] We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!
 Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
 We all have to share in the guilt. [Leela turns to Bender.] Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
 [off camera] Yay!
 Yay, salad!
 [off camera] Zoidberg! [Leela descends through the elevator and runs towards Zoidberg.] [on camera] We know about your secret agreement. [Leela points at herself with both her hands.] I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
 Another Yeti?!
 [shouting] We're back from the mission!
 Don't worry. Everything went fine.
 We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one.
 Nope. [She closes her locker door.] I've got a date with Chaz.
 I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
 I do go! He's a very important man.
 Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
 Hey, I hear Fry. [She walks over to him.] Boy, am I glad you're here.
 Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?
 And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. [shouting] Have a great night!
 Oh, Chaz!
 I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
 You reserved the whole rink?
 Oh, Chaz!
 Aw, let's let those kids skate with us.
 I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.
 This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
 Bender, would you do the honours?
 Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
 I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
 No.
 What little there is to be had.
 I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please.
 Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
 Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale.
 Pay dirt! [She closes the door and pulls the plug out of the socket.] Hi-yah!
 Anything else?
 OK, Mushu, it's feeding time! [She dives in, not stopping to look at the "Please Do Not Feed The Whale" sign. Chewing sounds come from beneath the water and Leela comes up at the side of the tank gasping for air and not wearing her swimming costume.] Oh, crud! He ate my suit.
 It's on fire!
 I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
 Me too!
 At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
 Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
 They're only a foot high, Professor.
 Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
 Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.
 No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
 Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
 Sh!
 I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
 Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
 How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
 Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
 --does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
 The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.
 Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
 We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
 Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
 Aw! That is so true and sweet.
 Fry, please try to understand: You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
 Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
 Fry, what are you doing?
 Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.
 Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
 Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--
 You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
 How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
 Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets.
 [on radio] Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
 [on radio] Roger.
 It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
 I guess not.
 OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance. [She is about to sit down when she sees Fry still looking sad.] Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
 [on intercom] Detonation in three, two, one.
 Then what?
 I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
 What?
 You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Lee-- [She covers her mouth.] La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Pert and Popular, sir.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
 Really? [disguised, deeper voice] What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
 [disguised, deeper voice] Aww, she sounds sweet.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Stop! Stop flattering me!
 [disguised, deeper voice] Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--
 Charge your gun, Fry.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
 [disguised, deeper voice] Bomb? What bomb?
 [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
 Hi-yah!
 [shouting] Come on! We gotta save Bender.
 Fry, don't you recognise me?
 Hey, Zapp!
 Let's do it again sometime.
 We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. [Fry stands at the door with a parachute on his back.] I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
 [shouting] I already did!
 We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
 Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
 Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
 Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.
 Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
 Just get in the car.
 They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.
 No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ... [He flexes his muscles.] ... handsome they are.
 Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
 It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
 Oh, my God!
 The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
 Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.
 Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
 Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
 [on screen] Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
 Bender, damage report.
 We did it! We won!
 This is hopeless. [She runs to the pilot's seat and sits down.] If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.
 You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
 They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
 Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
 Gimme the script.
 [reading] Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
 Sleeping with you.
 Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court... [whispering] Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
 What are we supposed to do now?
 Uh...
 I say ... I'm giving up the law. [She stands up.] And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?
 Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
 [reading] I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... [Farnsworth smiles weakly.] ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
 Wait! He pled "not guilty".
 The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
 [whispering] Sh! Those words are forbidden!
 Sh!
 You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
 But it's set 800 years in the past!
 Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
 We're entering the Omega system.
 I've lost control of the ship!
 But who's doing all this for you?
 Go [beep] yourself.
 What?
 For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
 Correct.
 Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
 We'll go wait in the ship.
 I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
 Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
 Fire!
 It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
 So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
 Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
 There. We can make these into spears.
 Then do it the wrong way.
 Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
 We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
 Hey, if your engines work--
 We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
 The Nimbus! We're saved!
 You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!
 One more hit and we're done for!
 Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
 How can you call the Native Martians "stupid"?
 I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.
 Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
 What happened to the buggalo?
 She's got a fine coat.
 Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
 Right in front of you.
 OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
 Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
 Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
 [shouting] Sandstorm! [The tornado picks up the buggalo and them. They tumble around inside the tornado and then fall to the ground.] We're in the eye of the storm!
 Who are they?
 Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
 What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
 They have such respect for the planet.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
 Yay, Kif!
 It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
 But what about your sacred land?
 Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
 Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
 Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
 Those poor 20th century women.
 Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
 Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
 I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
 [simultaneous] Stop!
 Bleck!
 Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
 It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
 Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
 At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
 If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
 Uh, me too.
 Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
 Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
 Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
 Aww.
 Right, right. [She turns to the Emperor.] You have to stop this madness.
 [shouting] Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
 Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
 Ew!
 Fry!
 Hooray!
 Great idea!
 Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
 Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
 Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say "ask" instead of "aks".
 Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
 That's not true.
 Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
 It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
 Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
 I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
 Hi, there!
 You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
 It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
 Merry Xmas.
 But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
 We're trapped.
 Goodbye, Fry.
 [shouting] Somebody help us.
 [shouting; from outside] Help!
 Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
 [singing] He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
 Hi, kids! [Leela waves.] What book would you like me to read first?
 [confused] What?
 Make something up? Um... Okay. [Leela sits on a small chair.] Once upon a time, there was a... A...
 Yes! That! [The orphans sound excited.] A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room...
 Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
 Yes, Albert?
 That's not really a question.
 [sad] I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller. [The small chair falls off.] [with conviction] But I promise: I'll make up a better story and come back again.
 See you soon!
 I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate! [Leela is annoyed by the trombone that Fry is playing "When the Saints Go Marching In" with.] [over the noise, screaming] Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?
 [over the noise, screaming] Zoidberg, I'm trying to—
 Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions. [Leela grabs her writing pad and stands up.] I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate.
 Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children. [Warden Vogel looks up at Leela.] I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one.
 Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?
 Hi! It's great to be back. [Leela proceeds to her right.] I think you'll enjoy this one.
 It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump. [Leela puts the mini-piano and the creatures in cardboard on the small shelf, unfolds the piece of cardboard, puts the piece of cardboard on the painting surface, revealing it to depict a landscape with two trees, and sits on the stool.] Kids, let's meet the Humplings! [Leela presses a button on the mini-piano and grabs the creatures in cardboard. The piano starts playing. Two other creatures can be seen. The first creature is orange and the second is both pink and yellow. Leela holds up the red creature.]
 Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.
 [in a different tone, off camera, singing] Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. [Leela is holding up the pink and yellow creature and holds up a gorilla wearing a backpack that is connected to his mouth by a pipe and holding a flower with his left hand.]
 Of course I'll tell you more stories. [Leela stands up.] I'll go think some up right now.
 Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
 [touched] Aw. [Leela folds her hands.] They were?!
 [sad] I dunno. [Leela shrugs.] Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?
 Okay. I'll do it! [Leela raises her right hand.] To show you kids you can succeed at anything. [Abner Doubledeal is holding a pen.] If you just luck out hard enough.
 Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
 [dressed as Lady Buggle] Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
 [dressed as Lady Buggle] It's very simple. [singing] If it's alive, don't lick it.
 [dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,
 [dressed as Lady Buggle] Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.
 Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.
 What?! My show is a hit?!
 Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you.
 Shh!
 Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.
 Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.
 Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am.
 I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
 This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
 Oh, hell.
 Wait! I can explain.
 You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down.
 Bender! I feel bad enough already.
 Oh, Lord.
 Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.
 [dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.
 Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration.
 Yes, Sally?
 Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?
 I can't do this any more.
 Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you.
 Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
 I didn't create anything. I stole it.
 No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!
 No need, Lady Buggle.
 This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
 I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
 You mean a frown?
 I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
 Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!
 I did!
 Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
 They were?! By who?!
 Oh, God! What have I done?!
 But—
 Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!
 [extendedly] No!
 Now, if you'll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain, I've prepared a video tribute to the happy couple. In their 40 years together, my parents have been through so much. Well, not that much, actually, since mutants weren't allowed to leave the sewers until last year.
 So, how did it all begin? The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University. She, a brilliant exolinguistics major, he, a laid-back sewer surfer who didn't even know the meaning of "exolinguistics".
 But sometimes opposites attract, and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant, the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day.
 Okay, take a deep breath. You're having a little lovers' quarrel, but I'm sure you'll work everything -
