 Did what?
 What's the matter compressor?
 Is it inside that box?
Hey! Well, let's break this ship in.
 Leela, Bender's bothering me!
The ship did everything? But we didn't have an adventure.
 Oh, right, it's Wednesday! Today we're gonna learn spinny kicks! Yay!
 What's going on? Why do I look like a stupid cartoon character? I feel like I lost weight. - All of it.
 Who said that? All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments.
Wow.How did he even know we're here?
 Got it.
 Which ship?
 My bowels returned at a bad time!
 What's with the seventeen dung beetles?
 Guess I better head over to my night job.
 Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job.
 Gotta go!
 [extendedly] Woo!
 Fry.
 I wanna go to that museum!
 Sorry, guys. You know the rules. "No fun allowed."
 No visitors! I'll lose my job.
 You're mean, Rutherford B. Hayes!
 Alright. One small get-together. But let's keep it quiet and dignified.
 Oh, boy.
 Really?! [The camera pans over to a shelf.] I'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover's head!
 Where are we? Also, when are we?
 I don't get it.
 [leaning into the frame] Now I get it!
 Duh! It says [points to the words on the currency] "Colony of Maffachufetts"!
 Bender bent a poo penny! Bender bent a poo penny!
 Aw, I gotta chipmunk.
 Look out! He's got a bezeling planisher!
 Here you go.
 From that old church to the north. [Fry points to a church.] They had two burning, so I figured they wouldn't miss one.
 [in a British accent] Where's all th' Presidents' heads, then?
 Con't we just go back in time an' set things roight again?
 [pointing somewhere] Wot about this bloke?  'e's from Revolutionary times.
 [speaking in his normal voice] There. That time, I left both lanterns in place.
 He's got me beat!
 He's dead.
 I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
 We gotta go rescue them!
 Bender! Think of the señoritas!
 Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
 I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
 Alright, here's the plan--
 Pft. A female leader?
 [saluting] Yes, Captain!
 Is she hot?
 In other words, "No". [Thog kicks him in the face and he falls over.] Ow!
 It was an accident, ma'am.
 Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.
 What'd they die of?
 Yes!
 [cheering] Yay!
 Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
 Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.
 [from inside] Ooh! Yeah!
 Can't we just cuddle? [She scoops him up.] [screaming] Nooo!
 Oh, yeah!
 Ooh!
 Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
 Does it really work?
 I'm so lonely since I came to the future. [He pulls out a slice of bread and offers it to a duck.] Will you be my friend? [The duck snatches away the bread and bites him.] Ow! [A shadow creeps over him. He looks up and Bender falls on him. Bender groans and sits up. Fry is wedged between his eyes. Fry gasps.] Who are you?
 You too? Will you be my friend?
 [shouting] Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
 Hey, Bender?
 Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
 [screaming] Nooo! [He climbs onto Bender.] [talking] Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
 Goodnight, sweet prince.
 Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
 Ew! What smells like boot feet?
 I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
 Whatcha eating?
 Sure. [He picks up one of Zoidberg's claws, dips it in sauce and takes a bite.] Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
 Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
 No?
 Then ... then ... it was you!
 Well, that covers the first three killings.
 I like it!
 I really like it!
 Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
 I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
 Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
 Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down in the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy Millennium! [He blows the noise maker and tips back on the chair. He loses his balance, falls and hits his head on a freezer.] Ow! [The dial on the machine sets itself. He rubs his head and holds up the noise maker.] I should have left you floating in the toilet!
 Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
 You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
 Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
 Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? [Hawking's eyes widen in horror.] 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it "a Fry Hole".
 [from alley] Who said that? [A man in a long coat and a woman with a beehive cast shadows on a wall. They start beating Fry.] Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
 Who are you people?
 I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
 Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
 Where am I, anyway?
 So what do you nerds want?
 No fair! I saw it first!
 So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
 But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
 Uh, what?
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
 OK, here I go.
 Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
 Destroyed? Then where are we now?
 Sure.
 Good work.
 Kinda game-y.
 [whispering] Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
 Speaking of which, try these nachos.
 [whispering] Pst! We found him!
 He's dead.
 Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
 Uh, what if that thing I said?
 Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
 Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--
 Hey, watch out!
 It's OK. I had another guy!
 Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!
 I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields.
 Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man.
 [sweating] It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me.
 What do you monsters want?
 I guess so.
 Ow!
 OK, crow, prepare to be scared. [He gets out Stephen King's Christine.] [reading] And then, "honk, honk," the car honked its own horn!
 Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
 Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
 That's great, Leela.
 Why does everyone keep saying that?
 Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
 Never mind, Professor. She came to.
 Sorry, you know too much.
 [sniffs as his nose bleeds] What smells like bloody sinuses?
 [throws out his phone] Sayonara.
 Wait.  I thought we were buying our eyePhones online.
 But I thought the Mom Store was across town.
 I feel like a mindless zombie.  I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.
 [panting] Are there any left?
 [taking out a wad of cash] Shut up and take my money!!
 Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology.  Why's it called an eyePhone?
 Neat.
 No wonder traditional media is dead!  Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad.
 What's happening to me?  Is it puberty?
 These eyePhones are phones, too?
 Fry-lo.
 Duh.  Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?
 Oh, that reminds me.  It's time to twit my hourly twupdate. [Fry records a twit on his eyePhone]  'Sup, followers?  Fry here. [belches] Burpin' eggs. [scratches his armpit] Scratchin' my underarm fungus.  Lookin' for love.  Send.
 Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?
 [twitting to Bender] You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send.
 [on screen] Help!  Police!
 That is low, Bender.  Even by your standards.
 Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
 I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level.  What do you say?  First one to a million followers wins a buck.
 What happens to the loser?
 Wait!  Let's make it interestinger! [the camera cuts to reveal that the goat has two heads as Fry turns it around] Vomit and diarrhea!
 Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet!  I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!
 Trust me, I want twits that tittle.
 Whose that?  The Queen of England?
 That was odd.  Where'd that singing come from?
 What the hell is that?
 You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?
 No, no.  [shrugs] Well...
 You named your boil Susan?
 Ew, she's Scottish!
 Woah, gross. [gets inspired] Million follower gross.
 What?  Oh.  Okay.
 [fake coughing and whispering] Send [fake coughing again]
 [in horror] Eh.
 Ih.
 [sighs] I know I shouldn't have twitted that but [he looks at the Twit Meter, which now has Bender at 934,802 followers and Fry just growing and growing inching closer to the same number of followers as Bender] not swimming in barf might ease my conscience.
 That's why we can't let her see this.  Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn't—EEEEE!
 Oh, I'm a scuzzball.
 Aaah!  I'm sick of my head doing things! [Leela comes up to him] Leela!
 No, I came to talk to you.
 I am so, so sorry for what I did.  And I know I can never make it up to you.
 I think you mean hit me.
 Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing.  I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through.
 I didn't? Damn.
 Can I have another hug?
 Hey!
 My God! It's full of ads!
 It's immense.
 So I see!
 Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
 [sarcastic] Uh, "video game" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.
 Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do-- [He jumps out and shoots Leela.] Gotcha! [She shatters. Fry jumps up and down cheering.] I won! I'm the greatest!
 Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
 Kicked your ass!
 Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
 Lazy sculptor!
 Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
 What's over that hill?
 Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak. [Leela slaps him.] Ow!
 Ow!
 Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.
 He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
 Try and stop me!
 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--
 You do?
 Then dump his one-eyed ass.
 I'll be there.
 C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!
 [whispering] No! No!
 [shaking hands] Welcome!
 Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
 The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
 That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
 Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
 But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
 Bender, snap out of it!
 Come on, boy, jump! [The lizards crash through the gate.] Good boy!
 My God! Four identical castles!
 That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
 Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
 Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
 And maybe you'd like to meet her. [A purple alien comes in.] And her.
 Hey, that's what I do.
 Wow! I love symposia.
 Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
 Who's the gross nerd?
 Who's that jerk?
 Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
 No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
 Did you build the Smellescope?
 Smells like strawberries.
 Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
 Oh. What's it called now?
 No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! [He points the Smellescope around the sky and sniffs.] Hmm. [He sniffs again.] Hmm.
 So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? [A hologram of the object hits the hologram of the Earth with a splat.] What the heck is it?
 Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
 Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
 The future is disgusting.
 Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
 Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
 Hmm, sporty!
 Wow!
 It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. [He picks up something.] Look! A real Beanie Baby. [He picks up something else.] Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! [He sees something and gasps.] Some Bart Simpson dolls!
 This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
 [gasping] Alright, let's get to work.
 We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
 We're saved!
 No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. [Poopenmeyer cringes.] Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
 Uh, what about garbage?
 Then it's time to make some more.
 Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can. [He knocks it on the floor.] Now it's garbage. These papers. [He sweeps them off the desk with his hands.] Garbage. This picture of your wife. [He drops it on the floor and the frame smashes.] Pure garbage. Now you try it.
 Good! [He turns to Leela.] Don't finish that cruller, throw it away [Leela throws it on the floor.] Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground. [Bender throws the bottle on the floor.] Very nice.
 [on TV] People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
 [on TV] Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
 Oops!
 It worked!
 Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
 That's the 20th century spirit!
 Did you find something, Hermes?
 [He scoops up some soup. Amy's finger is in the spoon.] What the...
 [Looking at a polluted pond.] Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.
 What's in the tube?
 Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?
 Whoa.
 [In the pond, using a robotic leaf as a boat.] Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me. [He is attacked by a robotic Plesiosaurs.] Help! Police!
 [The robot throws opens its mouth and Fry hits the ground, several feet away.] Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... [A robotic T-Rex grabs him in its jaws.]
 Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea. [Something crows and Fry screams. A robot Pterosaur carries him off.] This is a cool way to die!
 [Trying to avoid the babies Pterosaurs.] Ah! Don't eat my butt!
 Hey, looky here. [Mechanical flowers have sprung up,  there are animals everywhere.]
 Hey, looky there. [Amy and Leela are still being abducted.]
 We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. [He shows off a fan.]
 What's going on? How did we save you?
 [He whistles.] Nice net.
 Oh. [He takes the mic and the audience applauds.] Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! [Farnsworth smiles.] Roll film!
 [whispering] Dork alert!
 Leela! He could live another 100 years!
 Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
 A successor?
 Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
 Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
 One foot in the grave.
 Oh, yeah!
 Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
 Where did Cubert come from?
 Well, once in the park.
 Little twerp.
 We've gotta get him back.
 Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.
 Uh ... what?
 To the left! [He sniffs again and moves slightly.] No, to the up! [And some more.] U-turn! U-turn!
 I'm on it!
 I'd like to see them find it!
 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
 What? I'm old. Listen: [old man voice] Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!
 Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
 So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
 Will too!
 Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
 [fast] Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
 Try shocking him.
 Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
 So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
 Allow me, m'lady. [Fry takes off his pants and places them over the puddle.] Shall we go a-trousering?
 [dejectedly] You're right. I'm sorry for showing my love.
 Here, take my hand!
 My pants! My lucky pants!
 They are too! I was wearing them that time I found a dime in my ear! It was wearing them when I won a subscription to Redbook! And I was wearing them when I first met Leela, so, yeah, they're lucky!
 Plus, they're my only pants.
 I'm gonna blast that balloon! [Fry pushes a button labelled "TO GUN TURRET".] No way will I let God get my pants! [Fry sits himself down on a seat, which then lifts him up to the gun turret.] Nobody messes with my pants. Not even the Holy One. Blessed be He. [Fry presses the buttons of the gun turret and shoots the balloon, causing it to explode. Fry's pants fall back down to Earth.]
 I'll save you, pants! Scruffy, do you have any varmint grease?
 Woah, there's writing in here! [The flame from his match starts to ignite his body.] Also, this grease is flammable!
 Leela! Take my hand!
 I'm sorry. Normally, I would have wiped them on my pants, but–
 Are you okay?
 We made a rope from my shirt and jacket. [Fry points to a rope made of red and white cloth.] And an expedition flag from my underpants! [Fry lifts up a pole with a pair of underpants attached to it, labelled "OPERATION CYCLOPS DOWN" and bearing the symbol of a hawk with a single eye.] I'll help you up. Here, take my hand.
 All right! Lucky pants! [The badger, which is still in Fry's pants, moves around. Fry panics and screams, and the badger runs off.]
 So the world will end in three thousand twelve. Why does that year sound so familiar?
 Leela, I've made up my mind. Before we die, I'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of Tron Legacy! It may take a couple of hours, but–
 Zoidberg, get lost!
 A spaceship made of stone? With no electronics, it just might work!
 I'll miss you, Leela. [sniffles] But it's okay. Because then I'll die.
 I hate waiting in line to die.
 Well, might as well get it over with. [Fry takes his turn and puts his hand in the slot.]
 Yes! My lucky pants! Leela! We can go together after all! Come on, get your badge! Take my hand!
 You can't reject Leela! Give her a badge, you stupid box! [He punches the Contrabulous Choosematron, and ends up getting his hand back in the slot.]
 Nooo!
 [sadly] Okay. [He and Leela begin to walk away.] Will you at least keep this photo? [He pulls out a picture of him and Leela together at the Planet Express prom and gives it to Leela. He sniffles.] Remember how Bender dumped all that pig's blood on me?
 [sniffles] I wish I could remember with my boobs.
 Wait! I did it. I got a Leela a ticket! [He gives her an envelope.]
 A-ah-uh-uh! A magician never reveals his secrets. Except the Great Reveal-o!
 Bender! You're stealing your own stuff!
 Nah, I'm not hungry.
 No. 'Cause as long as Leela lives, I'll be alive too. In her heart. But really I'll be dead!
 You're right, Bender! Grave robbing is fun! And these piñas coladas are fantastic!
 All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.
 Of course I do. [Bender's eyes extend. In the sky and unbeknownst to Fry, Mars is seen moving dangerously close to Earth's surface.] But even though we're millions of miles apart, somehow, I feel she's near me.
 Another great thing was, she always had room for dessert! [Fry notices Mars in the sky and screams.]
 Hang on, Leela! I'll save you again!
 Quick! Take my hand! [He holds out his hand.]
 I got her.
 Oops! Try again!
 No, we're not! Grab your severed arm with your other arm! [He holds out Leela's severed arm.]
 Huraa... [Fry's arm is severed.] ...aaah!
 I hope you're not too mad at me, Leela. For tearing your arm off and all.
 One last...foolish gesture? [He holds his arm out.]
 I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! [He bangs on the wall.] (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!
 Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
 What a nightmare!
 What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
 So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
 But, how is that possible?
 That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
 Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
 Cool. [He walks over to a salesman.] Can I try these on before I buy them?
 Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
 $30? I can't afford that. Unless... [He pulls out his wallet.] Do you take Visa?
 American Express?
 Discover card?
 No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
 Hey who's the rocker jockey?
 Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
 [counting] 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
 Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
 Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
 Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
 Alright!
 Pizza dinner on me! [The others cheer.] Just keep the tab under $50 million.
 Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
 Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
 What?
 So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
 I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
 So? What do you think?
 What's wrong with it?
 Yes!
 I have an idea for a sitcom.
 Anchovies?
 15,000!
 50,000!
 Don't tell me how to spend my money.
 100,000.
 500!
 Two.
 14!
 One jillion dollars.
 Oh. In that case, 50 million.
 Now for some good old 20th century TV.
 Ah, those were the days.
 Eh?
 I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
 I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
 I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
 Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
 Just leave me alone.
 I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
 [on TV] Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza. [The tape rewinds.] It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--
 I didn't order any--
 Where am I?
 That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
 So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
 You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
 Hey, look! Anchovies!
 Ooh!
 Uh...
 Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
 Uh, cheese and a-- [Walt immediately picks up the boxed pizza and soda from under the counter.] That was quick!
 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
 Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
 No, that's not true!
 Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?
 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! [He sees what the repo-bot is carrying.] Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
 Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
 Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
 I was robbed. They got everything except these.
 Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
 You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important: My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. [Bender and Leela look at each other.] That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.
 What a nice lady!
 OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
 Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
 There aren't any more. And there never will be.
 Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called "Cannibalon"!
 This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
 Hey, uh, where's my suitcase? [His suitcase flies out from the tube and knocks him over.] Ow!
 Huh? [Leela eblows him.] Ooh! How do you do?
 Man, first class seems nice!
 Well at least we get a window!
 I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
 OK!
 Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
 Hmm? Mmm!
 Well, you got anything else for him?
 Hmm? Mmm!
 See you later, wuvvums!
 I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
 Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
 Go, Professor!
 Thank you, sir.
 Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
 [whispering] Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
 Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
 Uh...
 Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
 Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
 Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
 I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
 Yeah.
 And me.
 Talk about a mood killer!
 You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
 I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
 Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
 Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- [The nebula is sucked into the black hole.] Never mind!
 Goodbye, Bender.
 Look!
 Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
 What do we care? We live in the United States.
 Wow! I have been gone a long time.
 These are the candidates? They sound like clones. [He looks a little harder.] Wait a minute. They are clones!
 If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
 Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.
 Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
 The less fortunate get all the breaks!
 What party do you belong to, Bender?
 'Cause you're a robot?
 OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
 [sarcastic] Sure, you say that now!
 Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
 [downbeat] OK then, screw it.
 [excited] Alright!
 That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
 Too bad you can't spend it.
 No.
 Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
 This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
 Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
 Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
 Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
 I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
 Well, you're looking great.
 [shrugging] Couldn't hurt.
 [to Clinton] Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
 I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!
 Bender, what is it?
 It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
 Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
 Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
 Yeah, and that electric guitar.
 Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
 No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
 [whispering] Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
 Keep going, we're right behind you.
 Ooh! [Below, some more writing says "Thought Activated".] Uh-oh!
 Well, he lost my vote.
 Hey, I've got one last thought.
 What?
 Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
 Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
 I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
 Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
 Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
 Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!
 For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. [He holds up a jar of live bees.] Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.
 Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. [He turns the TV on and there is a blernsball game on.] Ah, the Earthican pastime: Blernsball!
 Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players.
 Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
 Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?
 Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
 [shouting] Go, Leela!
 Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers.
 And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
 Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
 Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
 [whispering] Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
 Hooray!
 Hey! You opened a franchise!
 [shouting] Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
 Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
 Well, there's the material rewards.
 Happy funeral, Bender!
 We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
 Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
 Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
 Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.
 I thought something looked different in here.
 Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
 Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
 You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
 Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
 I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.
 Also Wolfman!
 Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
 Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
 I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
 You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
 Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
 Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!
 What proof is this? Some huge number?
 Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. [Bender gasps.] Did you hear something, Leela?
 Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?
 That guy who used to bend things. You know?
 Hermes.
 Absolutely.
 Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
 [cheering] Alright!
 These letters are real butt-nutters! [He opens one.] Listen to this one: [reading] Dear Santa.
 It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!
 Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.
 Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?
 But you live in a gingerbread house.
 That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
 Faster! Faster!
 Why aren't we moving?
 He's trapped!
 And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
 Evil Knievel could!
 [singing] Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
 ,  and  [singing] It's back to work on Xmas Eve!
 [singing] Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
 [singing] These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
 Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink. [He tastes it and spits it out.] Ew! It went sour!
 Oh, no! The ice is melting!
 And your breezy short-shorts!
 Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
 I'm Santa Claus!
 Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us.
 This is horrible.
 Don't do it! He's evil!
 Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
 But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
 There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.
 So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.
 Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
 [shouting] We're not listening!
 Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
 They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
 Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
 Who are you, old man?
 I'll never remember that.
 Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
 You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
 Ow!
 I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?
 Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?
 Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine.
 Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
 You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
 Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
 Here!
 We were canceled?
 Why?
 Way to bend it!
 Go, Hermes!
 Can you save Hermes, Dr. Goodensexy?
 Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up?
 I'll show her who's immature.
 "Charles de Gaulle"? Never heard of you.
 Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy.
 That's not the wheel.
 "You must be at least this naked"? How much nakeder could you be?
 What?
 You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
 Here's your package, sir.
 Oh, sorry. Sign here.
 Well, that's not a...
 And initial here. [screams again OC]
 Thank you for using Planet Express.
 Me neither.
 Yeah!
 Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars.
 Yes, I'll show you out.
 It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?
 Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni.
 I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
 Philip J. Fry.
 That's right.
 What the hell are you talking about?
 It was bound to be somewhere.
 Can I pull up my pants now?
 But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?
 Owww!
 Why don't you just remove my tattoo?
 No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.
 [running] Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.
 Hmmmm!
 Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One!
 Hello 2000. I'm home.
 Happy new year.
 Hello 2000. I'm home.
 Happy new year.
 Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend.
 What's happening? Are you urinating?
 It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
 Did someone call me?
 Ooph!
 [sarcastic] Thank you, Lars.
 Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time.
 Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab.
 Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?
 (VO) Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza.
 [groans] Ohh, ice cold.
 (VO) That's when it hit me again ...
 But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm. [unzips pants and reads time code off his ass] Zero zero one one zero ...
 Nice kick, me.
 One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza.
 Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good.
 Whatever.
 (VO) That's when it hit me yet a third time ...
 [slaps himself on the forehead] You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money.
 Yuck, I touched my own butt.
 So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.
 So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?
 I wonder what his life was like?
 Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday.
 Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu.
 That's it. I don't see how things could get any worse.
 [watching Lars and Leela hugging across the alley, singing] Lars makes me puke. I bet she'd love me too If I was a blad headed kook.
 Now could things get any worse.
 [grumbling] Life saving goody goody ...
 [quietly] I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance.
 So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz?
 There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
 You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.
 Cheap lousy Lars.
 I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me.
 [to Bender] It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink. [laughs and exchanges pens]
 [snickering] Finally, a happy ending.  Are you okay, Leela?
 What happened, Santa?
 All right!
 Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device?
 What is it?
 It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!
 Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday.
 You remember when we first met?
 Meet me there in five minutes. It's important.
 Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy.
 Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins?
 I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt.
 But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part!
 Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years.
 He was a good man, Leela.
 You put the time code on my ass?
 I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?
 Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilà! [He lifts his shirt to reveal a large lump in the middle of his abdomen.] Wait, that's not it. [He twists to the left a bit to reveal a second hump.] Ah, thar she blows!
 Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
 Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once.
 That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
 So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
 Bender, smell this milk.
 Professor, something's bothering me.
 Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender.
 No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons.
 Okay, I will.
 Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
 Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
 Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk.
 [Standing in front of the group with a ladle in his hand.] Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you.
 Yeah, that.
 Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head. A bus hits him] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
 Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
 He's at a spa.
 Me, too.
 Scientists like you!
 Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?
 I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross.
 Those three exterminators are hilarious.
 There. The repairs are complete.
 Hmm, uh, ladies first. [She pushes him through the blades, picks up Farnsworth and hops through. They're walking through a tunnel.] Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. [His pants have been cut open. The crew throw their jackets into a bin labelled "CLOTHES FOR THE GREEDY." Farnsworth presses the call button on a maintenance elevator.]
 Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
 There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think.
 Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
 Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
 Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
 Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time.
 Well, you're cuter that way.
 The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
 Can I also guess Mom?
 This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
 Save us, Catman.
 Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
 Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
 So that's where babies' sweaters come from!
 Man, I wish we had a Robot to do stuff.
 [sad] Don't feel bad, sir. It's not your fault. You probably just inherited your appearance from your mother.
 Don't wait for me.
 Oh, dip!
 Like the Kardashians.
 Chug! Chug!
 Minds?
 No, listen. I... freakin' love you. But I don't throw that word around!
 He's here for revenging. That's why.
 Blunder? You're the only one who's sober. You gotta do somethin'.
 Please... Stop the monster. Just do that one thing.
 What if I folded the Professor's sweaters for you?
 Yeah. To save the world.
 Sucker.
 [extendedy] No!
 Bender, you did it!
 Looks like it's full of dig dogs.
 I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?
 No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.
 [cheering] Yeah!
 No, thanks. That's robot food.
 No, really, I don't-- [Bender stuffs a spoonful in his mouth and he screams as his tongue catches fire. The flame goes out and Fry tastes it and smiles.] Mmm!
 $1200?
 No! No! I was just picking my nose.
 He's made of candy.
 [cheering] Alright!
 But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
 [from outside] OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
 Bender's sick. [Leela presses the button and the ship rises into its 45-degree launch position. Fry eats a sundae and talks with his mouth full.] Need any help taking off?
 Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.
 Uh, Leela?
 Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!
 Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
 No!
 [whispering] Oh, no! Poor Bender.
 Leela, we may not have much time left ... [Bender sneaks past them to an empty chair.] ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
 You're OK!
 I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.
 It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
 Unh!!
 Nah, I had it coming.
 This show's been going downhill since season three.
 Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
 Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
 [shouting; from outside] Yay, Bender!
 Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
 Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
 Hey, Bender. [Cubert walks past with a Bender portrait.] Hey, Bender. [Dwight struggles with a safe marked "Bender's Loot".] Hey, Bender. [The phone rings. Fry picks up.] Hey, Bender.
 Hear, hear!
 Nothing good.
 [singing] We've got nothing better to do.
 [singing] We don't wanna know!
 Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! [He opens the packet and Bender eats one. Something clangs around inside of him and he shits a brick. Then some.] There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
 No, it's an old Volkswagen van. [He wipes the window clean and sees some hippie skeletons inside.] [shouting] Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?
 Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
 It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!
 No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.
 Under the seat.
 It just needs some gas.
 Like what?
 Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
 Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
 Oh, no!
 Oh, no! This is terrible.
 Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
 No, why?
 Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
 Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?
 Yeah, I like it.
 Oh, yeah!
 Mine too, even my change.
 Surprise!
 Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
 Yeah!
 Bender, you can move! You're cured!
 Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
 Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!
 [shouting] Bender rules!
 Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
 Is any of that a problem?
 Phew!
 [shouting] C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
 Making the noise.
 Yep.
 That doesn't look like an "L" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
 Who would do a thing like that?
 Huh?
 Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
 You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!
 You're only four years old?
 Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
 I wish! It's a nickel.
 Alright!
 She sure does.
 Yeah. Either that or be a man.
 That's thinkin' like a man.
 Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
 So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
 But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?
 I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity.
 But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
 You gotta tell me: You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
 But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?
 I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man.
 Cool. What's for dinner?
 That's marriage alright!
 So now you do wanna marry him?
 Eck!
 Check.
 Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ... [He pulls out a spear.] ... is from Congo Jack.
 Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
 Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
 Ew!
 C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy.
 Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. [His knight charges at the bishop and the bishop batters it to the ground with his crook. The horse pulls out a dagger, stabs the bishop and kicks him off the game board. Fry chuckles and reclines in his seat.] Check.
 [hoarse] Good move.
 Sorry.
 DOOP? What's that?
 Uh...
 [getting it] Oh!
 Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
 So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
 That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
 Hey, Bender?
 You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
 She's really strict.
 No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
 Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
 Yeah!
 Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
 I agree.
 Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
 Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.
 Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
 Underpants?
 This is a mutiny.
 All hail the new captain.
 We don't have a brig.
 You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
 Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
 Ten hundred percent!
 Ooh, burn!
 This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... [He screams and makes explosion noises.] ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
 Good, good, then what?
 Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
 Leela, we want you to be captain again.
 We want Leela to be captain again.
 Absolutely.
 And warm.
 It's too low.
 And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
 Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
 Please?
 Aw, man.
 It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off.
 Let's just get inside the shack.
 Ow!
 Shows what you know. [Fry turns forward and resumes walking.] Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky. [Fry falls through the ice, screams, and resurfaces.] Help! I'm drowning!
 I love ice fishing.
 Pfff! [Fry points at Professor Farnsworth with his right hand.] You dunno what cold is. [Fry turns away from Professor Farnsworth. Amy, Fry, Hermes, Zoidberg, Professor Farnsworth, and Leela resume walking.] I was frozen for a thousand years.
 No. No crazy technology. [Fry grabs a cutting tool with his left hand.] Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way.
 And... Woilà [sic]!
 Everybody's ice-fishing! [Fry looks around.] How come nobody's ice-fishing?
 Cocoa is for yodelling babies. [Fry grabs a can labelled LÖBRAU BEER with his left hand.] If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing.
 Mom, what's my temperature?
 I'm really sick.
 I fell through the ice! [Fry sits up.] Cut me some slack!
 And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester.
 Ooh.
 No.
 No. You're not gettin'— [Yancy Fry Jr jumps at Fry, making him and a guinea pig in a cage on the bedside table fall on the floor. Yancy Fry Jr pushes against Fry's chin.] Ow! My underbite!
 Dad! [Yancy Fry Jr grunts as he pushes Fry's face against the floor. There is a flyer reading NERD SEARCH '88 SCIENCE COMPETITION.] Nerd Search '88? [Fry turns to his left.] What's this?
 I can make a space experiment. [Fry turns to his left.] I just got a new thing o' glitter!
 [angry] Yeah, well, I'll show you. [Fry points at Yancy Fry Sr with his left hand.] [sad] And Mr. Bananas. [back to normal] Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold! [Fry looks around.] Where's that contest flyer?
 Oh, good.
 [sad] I feel awful. [happy] But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish.
 It's nothing. [Fry scratches his nose with his right hand and sniffs.] Just a common cold.
 It's just a cold! [Fry sneezes aggressively.] What's the big deal?
 Look: I just 'ave a common [screaming] cold! [Fry turns to the male CDC scientist and then to the conference table.] It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.
 Huh. [Fry turns to his right.] So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
 Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus.
 I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.
 Pfff! [Fry turns to Yancy Fry Jr. Barack Obama leaves.] I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
 Game on, Gedgie.
 You'd better stay here during biology. [Fry puts the cage in an open locker.] Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader.
 Maybe I am... LL Fool J!
 [angry] No! [happy] I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!
 But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!
 We'll show him who's stupid.
 Phew! [Fry turns to the others.] Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys.
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are you—
 What good is a wool—
 There is? [Fry raises his arms.] [extendedly] Yay!
 [extendedly] Woo!
 [continued] Woo! [extendedly] Yay! Yay! [Fry turns to Professor Farnsworth.] So what's the catch?
 It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake.
 Jeez! [Josh Gedgie opens his eyes.] Walk much, Gedgie?!
 He already survived in the vacuum of my mom. [Fry shrugs.] I mean, "My mom's vacuum."
 Hey, wait a second! [Fry looks at Professor Farnsworth.] I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!
 We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
 We'll find that cold virus. [Fry raises his left fist.] The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
 Let's dump it up!
 No! [Fry walks forward.] It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down. [Fry raises both his fists.] Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
 Let's just hope the experiment's still in here. [Fry opens the frozen satellite with his left hand.] Yes! We're saved!
 Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart.
 Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot.
 I could've flip-flopped out.
 Man, it's hot! [different voice] How hot is it? [normal voice] It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off. [He chuckles.] Johnny Carson said it.
 Wait! Where do we get the ice?
 Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
 Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! [He chuckles.] Yakov Smirnov said it.
 Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
 Bender? Are you crying?
 What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
 Good for him!
 Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas.
 Professor, no! Don't do it!
 That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part.
 Be brave, my friend.
 Aha!
 Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
 I won't let you!
 Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
 Why isn't this working?!
 Yeah, that'll show those poor!
 True. But someday I might be rich, and people like me better watch their step!
 I found Bender!
 Sure, we are!
 Yeah. You explained his positions in a way even an idiot could understand. And that appealed to me, for whatever reason.
 You said it!
 I'll come. As long as there's no xenophobes there.
 So, you're not from Earth after all.
 You're from the future?
 I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
 Oh, well. Want to hear about how I got frozen?
 If it's on TV, it has to be real!
 Wow, it really doesn't matter who you vote for.
 I don't remember!
 It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
 I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
 Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
 Home run!! Woooo! Right?
 What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
 Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
 Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
 What just happened?
 What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
 Eleven?
 What's wrong?
 Well, aren't they?
 Why is that great news?
 Really? Which one?
 Man that one was a blast!
 So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
 Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
 Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
 Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
 Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
 Well what are we going to do?
 [robot voice] : I am fully operational Captain.
 I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
 Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
 Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! [He sort of dances like a robot.] Eh?
 Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
 I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
 Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
 Uh...
 I think the leak's stopping itself. [It doesn't.] Wait. [Still going.] Wait. Yeah, there we go. [Starts again.] Wait. Yeah!
 Wow the 3-D's great!
 God help us!
 Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
 I'm over here!
 It's him. He's OK!
 Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
 My God! He's become evil. [Leela stares at him.] I mean eviler!
 Psst! Bender!
 We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
 We're rescuing you.
 Say what?
 But Bender, we're your friends.
 That's not true.
 Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
 Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?
 Call technical support.
 No!
 Oh yeah.
 You don't look very old.
 But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
 Damn right!
 Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
 So long suckers! [The robots stand on each others shoulders] Uh, hello suckers!
 We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
 But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
 Whatever. It doesn't really matter.
 Well, in that case, don't wear them.
 You did it, Bender! You got away with things!
 [to Bender] So, you want a piece of gum?
 Whoa, that's pretty deep. [He puts a stick of gum in his mouth, offers Bender another.] So, you want a piece of gum?
 What's happening?
 Oh, lord.
 It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.
 Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?
 Yeah...wh-what? [Bender bends the bars.]
 [standing behind an armchair] What's this chair-looking gizmo?
 Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!
 I could stuff myself.
 You mean the window?
 I'll have the Stroganoff.
 Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
 Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
 I'm scaroused!
 FERTILE? What does that mean?
 What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster.
 Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!
 Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting.
 Think of the unborn embryo!
 Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!
 I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg.
 Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
 No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
 Look: I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying.
 Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
 Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing.
 That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
 But it loves me! And I love it.
 Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
 Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already.
 So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push.
 No!
 Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
 I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
 It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
 He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep.
 What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
 Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?
 I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down.
 No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me.
 Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones.
 Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you.
 Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round.
 Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
 I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne "The Rock" "The Tooth Fairy" Johnson.
 It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
 Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you.
 One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please.
 All kinds.
 I like those odds. [Something rattles around in his can and he gasps. He empties it onto his hand. It's a tooth.] Rats. Just another tooth.
 I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
 This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
 I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.
 Nope. Human.
 I 'unno. Try it on me. [Bender turns it on and points it at Fry's crotch. Fry doubles over in pain.] Ow! My sperm!
 Huh, didn't hurt that time.
 What's wrong?
 All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty. [He sees a stack of Slurm cans in the corner. Next to them is a life-sized cardboard stand-up of Slurms MacKenzie and the babes. A speech bubble comes from Slurms' mouth with "Win A Party With Me" written on it. Fry picks up a can.] Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
 Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
 We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. [He points behind him to a cart full of Slurm merchandise including Slurm coats, a cooler of Slurm cans, eight Slurm blernsball caps, a Slurm motorbike and a Slurm jet-ski.] I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
 [wheezy] Hooray!
 Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
 So, what's the secret ingredient?
 Oh. But what is it really?
 Why?
 So thirsty.
 Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
 When will that be?
 That's not soon enough.
 I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
 Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. [He laughs and tumbles in. He waves his arms around.] Help! I can't swim!
 This isn't Slurm at all!
 My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
 Oh. How is it?
 Look! Slurm! Finally! [He points at a conveyor belt with cans of Slurm on it. He walks over, picks up a can and drinks from it.] Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
 Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh. [He takes another swig.] Mmm, still warm.
 Ew!
 That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
 Ew!
 Thanks, Bender!
 Whose behind does that come from?
 What about me?
 Yes!
 Mmm!
 Here I come. [He sees the tub of Slurm.] Let me just-- One more taste.
 I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
 [screaming] Nooo! [He sticks his head between the grate and tries to lick up the Slurm.] [talking] I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
 Say what?
 But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
 Outlaw Slurm? [He looks at a can and runs between Farnsworth and the screen.] Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir...
 [on screen] Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
 Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
 [simultaneous] For Slurms!
 Mmm!
 What?
 Most folks just call me orange Joe.
 Bring on the beer! And the scantily-clad barmaids! And the more beer!
 Hey! I don't smell Bavarian-style vomit. Where's Oktoberfest?
 No chance! You can all act like Jersey shore socialites, but at least Bender will party with me. Right, buddy?
 Ach du freakin' lieber!
 Man, all the fun has been taken out of this once-noble barf-a-palooza.
 Well, at least we were hammered! Oh, I'm as thirsty as a drunk. Where do all these child-sized beers come from?
 Not all the beer.
 [drunkenly] Yay! Whoo-hoo! Fahrvergnügen! Kaiser permanente! Fru frusen gladje!
 I don't care! I'm finally having fun! Hey, come on, you keister-meisters! Eins, zwei, drei, vier! Lift your Stein and drink your beer!
 Whoa! Even with harps, that's still the famous Oktoberfest chicken dance! (All groaning, gasping) Oh, I almost forgot! (Chicken hats squeaking) Get das Booty up here, Leela! I brought his-and-her chicken hats! (Squeaks)
 [gasps] We were going out?! Whoo! I mean, nooo!
 and-and the worst part is, I had to have the breakup sex by myself! [sobs]
 I hate future Oktoberfest! It's supposed to be beer and bratwurst, not breakups and...boring thing!<poem>
 I didn't know this ship had a mammoth detector.
 Uh, Bender? I smell burning tusk.
 Neanderthal? Yeah, I think somebody called me that.
 So my sadness makes perfect sense. And I do have vague memories of people refusing to breed with me.
 But, chief, this means we're not trapped any more! It's our chance to take back the outside world from those stuck-up homo sapiens with their tools and their pants and such. My fellow big-brows! Are you with me?
 Kill all modern humans!
 Battalion A, smash things! Battalion B, smash different things!
 We want our land back! Also, to be treated as equals! And a little mating wouldn't hurt!
 Purple?
 Now this is Oktoberfest! Just like the olden days.
 No, Leela. Just this once, I'm going to let you embarrass me.
 [whispering] Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
 Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!
 So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
 This is perfect for me.
 Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
 [whispering] Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?
 Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
 No question!
 They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.
 I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. [Everyone mutters. Fry pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from his jacket.] My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?
 [whispering] Package delivery.
 I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
 No, thanks. I make my own.
 No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. [He pulls his trousers down and moons Mom.] Look at my butt!
 Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him! [He laughs.] Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities.
 Uh, work really, really hard?
 Oh, thank God!
 This company's on the fast track to the "It" list. Blast back kudos all around!
 Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
 Tonight, that's us!
 Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
 Don't you worry about "blank". Let me worry about "blank".
 [weakly] What a pleasant surprise!
 I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be.
 [muttering] Call me a "booger blaster"! I'll blast a booger so hard that--
 Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about "blank".
 What? I haven't changed. [He presses his intercom.] Suz? Have I changed?
 Thanks, doll.
 You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that.
 Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
 I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
 Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
 I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!
 Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands. [He gets his hat and coat then hesitates.] Reschedule.
 [on screen] As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now.
 So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?
 Oh, my God! His boneitis!
 He's dead.
 I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares.
 I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew. [The stock price changes to 114.] But some things I had to learn myself. [It changes to 99.] I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ... [57.] ... people you love. [46.] You can't put a price on that. [28.] So I'm giving up control of the company ... [107.] ... to a man of enormous experience ... [115.] ... Professor ... [150.] ... Hubert Farnsworth.
 You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
 In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--
 Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you.
 It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
 Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together.
 [shouting] See you guys Monday!
 Giant balloon?
 I feel better now. [The parade continues. Two men dressed in green are holding a sign reading St. Patrick's Day Parade, a dragon is sustaining a sign reading CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE, six blue Aliens are circling the road in their spaceships, and Bender is still carrying Fry on his back.] Why is so many different parades smooshed together?
 What's Parade Day?
 [in slow motion] I'll save one of you!
 I dunno. Fry?
 Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess.
 It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me. [Fry sees something before him, stops, and blinks.] Huh?
 What?
 No, no... Well, yes, actually.
 He did it. [Fry walks up to the conference table, where Amy, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Hermes are sitting. He lays Bender's body on the table.] He actually did it this time.
 Our what?
 I miss 'im so much.
 He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher. [Fry struggles to rip off Bender's arm.] I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter.
 What the— [Bender's ghost flies into Fry's toothbrush. It, too, attacks Fry. Fry screams as he attempts to free himself from the toothbrush. Bender's ghost flies into a razor, turns it on, and starts flying around Fry.] No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
 Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
 I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
 [as he is slapped] Ow! Ow! Ow!
 All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
 Gho—
 Now do you believe me?!
 [to the gypsy] Is it a ghost?!
 A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
 Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!
 So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute. [Fry throws the firewall onto the bed. It projects a holographic image of his face that melts down into a skull and he screams. Fry's heart is now beating noticeably fast and Fry begins to faint.] A heart attack! [Fry's heart stops beating.] Yup, I was right.
 The machines. They're after me!
 I guess it's for the best. [Bender's ghost's head emerges from the heart monitor and woos.] The only machine I'll ever miss is... [Fry whimpers.] Bender.
 Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend.
 Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise.
 Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me.
 And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
 Bender?! Is that thou?
 Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!
 Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime. [Fry is slapped by Bender's arm.] Ow!
 You're back from the dead?!
 Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much! [Fry lets go.] Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?
 Space pirates?
 Come on! Come on!
 Firing torpedo number three!
 Go after him, Leela!
 You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
 [solemn] He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest.
 Can you find him, Professor?
 No, thanks, I don't--
 Well, I guess that sounds OK.
 What? Really?
 He decided not to let go. [He puts the picture down and looks at one on the wall of Bender sat on a throne dressed as Napoleon.] I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!
 So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
 Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
 Bonder? Is it really you?
 Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
 Only if you don't have any real hope.
 I've not heard of them.
 You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
 Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat.
 You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!" [He is still covering his ears.] [shouting] I'd also like a pack mule.
 OK.
 And then what?
 Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender.
 Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
 That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
 [shouting] Bender? Bender?
 [shouting] Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
 [sad] You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood. [He spins the dish controller.] But still, I wish I had Bender back.
 Bender! It's a miracle! [He hugs him and burns himself.] Ow!
 We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
 Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
 This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
 Sure!
 Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
 Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.
 Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
 Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
 Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
 Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
 Who was that guy?
 Bender? No way! [The lights dim.] I definitely would've noticed something.
 I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
 A little. [Leela cringes. Bender sits in the corner chewing his fingers.] You OK, Bender?
 What's happening? I-I feel weird!
 And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
 Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
 Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
 Does that mean we can eat now?
 Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
 Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
 We've got to get the old Bender back.
 Uh, this.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
 Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
 And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
 Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
 Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
 Look's like we got the old Bender back!
 Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here. [Nibbler yelps.] Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
 Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
 Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
 Actually--
 [singing] I don't feel well.
 [singing] Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
 [singing] Maybe he's back at the motel.
 [singing] My ass has blisters from the slide.
 Bender, are you alright?
 Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
 [whispering] No. Do you?
 Run!
 Good old Bender!
 I'll play.
 Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
 Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
 What's with the specs, Bender?
 Hey!
 It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
 Oh, man!
 Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
 [whispering] Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.
 [ashamed] I thought it would fit.
 Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
 Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm "Phry" with a P-H.
 What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
 [bashful] Oh, stop!
 Just like very other girl I've dated.
 Alright!
 Morgan? It's 3am.
 Eat and sleep.
 Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.
 [shouting] Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
 Hey, what did you do to him?
 But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making. [Morgan puts the disk in a red tube and sends it away.] What did you do now? Stop doing things!
 No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
 I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
 I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
 Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
 Man, how long is this gonna take?
 OK.
 We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?
 You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
 Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?
 Yeah!
 That's right, she fraternised me!
 What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
 I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
 [pointing to his hair] And great lift!
 Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
 Hey, Professor, great jerky!
 Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
 Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
 I know but I forgive you.
 Uh-huh.
 Right.
 Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
 So, who's that weird-looking guy?
 What's he do?
 Boring!
 Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
 It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
 What are the cigars for?
 I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
 I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
 Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
 Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
 It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
 Wait, Bender. Bender?
 Bender, wake up!
 Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
 Bathroom.
 Bathroom!
 Ah, never mind!
 Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? [Leela twists his neck back properly.] Now you're OK.
 [sexily] Is that an invitation?
 Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
 Well, I'm moving out!
 I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
 Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
 Well, I give up. What's the catch?
 Not one place even remotely liveable.
 Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.
 Ooh!
 Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
 Ooh! [He takes off a miniature banana, peels it, eats it and tosses the skin on the floor. Amy slips over it and screams.] Hey, Amy!
 Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
 Hey!
 Sh! The wedding's about to start!
 Is he objecting or backing up?
 It just went out.
 [shouting] Come back, Bender! It's working!
 It's out again.
 It's back on!
 It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
 Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
 Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
 I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
 Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
 Hey, thanks for coming.
 Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
 Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
 Same thing.
 What up?
 Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
 Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
 Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
 Oh, stupid TV! [Enter Bender.] Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
 Don't do it!
 Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
 Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
 But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
 Hey, it works! The static's gone.
 She's right.
 Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
 What's wrong?
 Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
 It's good to be home.
 So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
 This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
 I say no.
 [giving Leela a bag of trail mix] I made you some trail mix for the flight. [Leela takes it as Fry picks up a huge painting of himself in a robe smoking a pipe] Also this picture to remember me by.
 Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
 Why isn't Leela back yet? [to Bender] Do you think she's okay?
 Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?
 [taking a piece of one of the satellites out of his hair] Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
 You mean...
 [taking the bullhorn from Farnsworth] Don't do it! It's not worth it!
 Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
 Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.  [opens his eyes to reveal that Zoidberg is now holding his hand] Bender?
 Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump. [about to do his business but then sees Leela] Leela? You're alive! [runs to her]
 Yay!
 For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!
 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
 [unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
 Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
 Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
 Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. [He takes a $100 bill out of his sock.] Damn! Still only $100.
 He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
 Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. [He scratches a panel on the "Whiff-n-Win" ticket.] Cherry. [Another panel.] Cherry! [The last one.] Mule. Crud!
 [shrugging] You gotta spend money to make money.
 I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
 You're right. You're right. It was--
 I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
 [from box] Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
 [from box] Ow! My chin!
 I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
 Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--
 What the--
 Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? [He lifts up his gown and grabs his belly.] I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
 I do other human stuff! I age! See?
 The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
 [shaking his hand] Actually, we've met once before.
 My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
 I don't wanna!
 You do?
 Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?
 Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
 But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
 You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot. [The Pay 'n' Chew robot coughs and a Bachelor Bar falls onto the floor.] Gimme! Gimme!
 At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
 [shouting] Help me! For God's sake, help me!
 [sleep-talking] Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? [He hears a whirring outside and wakes up.] [talking] Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?
 Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
 Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
 [shaking] Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
 N-- N-- N--
 No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
 I'm not a robot! [shouting] I'm not a robot!
 [mechanical voice] Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...
 [mechanical voice] Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
 [mechanical voice] Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.
 Oh, you sad, worthless human.
 Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
 Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. [He looks at the paperwork.] What is the meaning of this symbol?
 I'll show ye!
 Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
 Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
 Beep.
 [drunk] Alcohol fuels my power cells. [He stands up.] And as a mighty robot, I-- [He burps and falls back onto the couch, tipping it over backwards.] Beep.
 Halt, fellow robot!
 The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
 Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.
 No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
 [mechanical voice] It was nothing. I-- [He sees his bleeding arm and screams. His wipes some onto his finger and looks at it.] [normal] Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--
 A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
 I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
 Aw. Thanks, Bender.
 Who are you noisy women?
 [He chuckles.] You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable.
 I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?
 You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air.
 Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
 Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious.
 I believe you.
 I said, "Loud and clear." Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker.
 I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
 That's a plus.
 Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts. [Punches are heard and Fry is thrown out of the room.] Oh, wait, that's invisibility.
 Sign me up for the tournament, please.
 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament.
 Psht, I'm not crazy.
 So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?
 [He walks up to the table.] Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you.
 Bite my shiny metal hat.
 He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
 I call your bluff.
 But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!
 All right, all in. [Leo deals the cards.] Yes! Four aces!
 But how is that...
 Oh, my God!
 Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
 Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.
 Where's the hole?
 [He laughs.] Hey!
 Except in Kansas.
 Yo, that's messed up.
 Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me.
 Psst! Leela.
 I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here.
 You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know.
 Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?
 So, what brings you to Earth?
 Okay. Here goes.
 Where are you? And me?
 Yeah, I get that a lot.
 Take me to him.
 Hey.
 Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like "grok" and "junk."
 Especially "commune." Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field.
 Ooh. "Reasons unknown." Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer.
 Nice.
 Hey, I'm on TV. [He waves.]
 Neat. What's it got to do with me?
 Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save.
 Me? Why?
 Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
 Oh, okay. I foot-swear.
 I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
 Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up.
 I'm good at keeping nutcases.
 I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
 I'll have to do better than that.
 Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries.
 Yeah, I get that a lot.
 Except in Kansas.
 Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache.
 Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards "L."
 No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch.
 That hurt, but I can take it.
 Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.
 Sorry.
 Thanks.
 [He looks at the screen on the phone. It reads "GAME OVER."] No!
 Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil. [There is a tapping in the darkness. Fry shines his flashlight around.] What's going on in there? A scary noise? [He spots Frida hammering a protest sign into the grass.] Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. "Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! [He tries to pull the hammer from Frida's grip.]
 [He shushes her.] I'm on your side.
 Please, can you take a message to Leela?
 Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.
 [He rolls his eyes.] Just tell her.
 Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10. [He sees Hutch.] My dirty, shifty friend?
 Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster.
 Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks.
 Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?
 [He is taking notes.] "Must let happen."
 "Must let occur."
 Cooperation, because life is a team sport.
 Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!
 Even Celine Dion?
 Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!
 So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
 Is it edible?
 And here I am.
 That's good.
 So, where is this egg?
 And what does it look like?
 You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.
 Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
 You mean, like, people?
 You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
 Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
 What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain... [Nine motions "No!"] Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?
 Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
 Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
 Of course, don't you trust me?
 I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.
 But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
 Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!
 Wow! It's incredible.
 I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me.
 Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return.
 Previously, on Futurama.
 Oh, my God!
 Yeah, I get that a lot.
 Except in Kansas.
 Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent.
 Well, abducted is such an ugly word.
 You and me?
 Tomorrow?
 Ka-boom?
 Hello? Madfellows? I need to- [He is hit on the head with a bottle and passes out. Small time lapse and he awakens.] Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now.
 But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
 That's it?
 What does that look like?
 But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?
 So, what's your plan to recognize it?
 Got it.
 That was a mistake.
 Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
 [He drops a wire.] Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.
 Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on.
 I can't tell you.
 Because... Because...
 Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you.
 It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything. [He throws the plunger to the floor.]
 Leela?
 Hutch, are you okay?
 What? [It is pulled out of his head and he screams.]  Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?
 Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
 I guess he didn't hear me.
 Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you.
 Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela.
 What do we do? Should we go for it?
 I just saw something incredibly cool: A big, floating ball that lit up with every colour in the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried.
 Yeah.
 Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own.
 How can you people be so blasé? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from.
 Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
 [sexfully] Everything?
 Yeah, what did they ever do for me?
 I wanna see the edge of the universe!
 Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
 Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
 [shouting] Yee-haw! Bow before your master, puny mortals! [He hoots.] Giddy-up!
 That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
 The tongue tickles.
 These new hands are great. I'm gonna break 'em in tonight.
 I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
 OK.
 It is?
 [reading] Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?
 Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!
 Ooh! eBay!
 So where's the celebrity dating place?
 Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
 I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?
 I'd like the 2003 model.
 I've found her! What do I do now?
 It worked!
 [muffled] It worked perfectly!
 Did you hear that? She likes me!
 But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
 Uh, not right now.
 So, uh, what do you feel like doing?
 I said later!
 Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more.
 Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
 You're cute!
 You!
 You!
 You!
 Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.
 This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
 Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. [He notices Liu and gasps.] Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?
 Let me see. [He kisses her.] Yep. Why do you ask?
 [shouting] Quick! This way!
 Sorry, ladies. Employees only.
 Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot.
 What are you doing, darling? Get down!
 You saved us. Are you alright?
 What? No!
 But I just downloaded her because I love you.
 I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot.
 Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
 But, but--
 Is it me?
 You alright, Bender?
 Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
 Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
 Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
 [singing] And you smell like one too!
 Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
 And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
 [whispering] Thanks for covering.
 What's your problem?
 You do?
 What?
 [crying] They're just responding to my personality.
 [shouting] The spoon's in the foot powder.
 Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
 Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
 Bender? Bender?
 Have you seen my sombrero?
 Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.
 Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
 God bless America.
 Phew! Uh, ladies first.
 Oh, and the aftertaste!
 I burned my finger.
 Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.
 Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. [He points the torch at something in the water.] Or maybe it's whatever that is.
 Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. [He points his torch at an extremely thin pipe. Bender and Leela glare at him.] Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
 OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
 I'll take care of this! [He sets the end of the guidebook alight and points it at the mutants.] Back! Back!
 Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
 Daylight and everything.
 Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
 So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
 I'll take care of this.
 Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
 Even me?
 Damn.
 Bender's gonna be killed!
 [cheering] Yeah!
 Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
 Amazing! That's why they call you "Bender the Magnificent"!
 Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
 Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
 Sure. Lots of people did.
 Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! [He grabs the paddle.] And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
 Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff. [He walks over to a display case.] Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--
 Pizza delivery for Mr. ... [He checks the note.] ... Seymour Asses.
 I wouldn't count on that.
 Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ... [He offers the dog a slice.] ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. [The dog snaffles the slice.] I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other. [He hands Seymour another slice.] People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man "Mister". [He gets up and gets on his bike.] Well, goodbye. [He does the Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper.
 No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say! [He grabs Bender by his foot and uses him to smash the display case. He takes Seymour and Bender hops around holding his foot, screaming in pain.] I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. [Two security guards grab him.] Uh-oh!
 Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
 I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
 You're right. [He gets up.] I'll give it a shot!
 [into megaphone] Fry's dog!
 [into megaphone.] Fry's dog! [The crowd cheers.] I will now perform my people's native dance.
 [singing] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [Seymour howls along with the tune.] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [He locks his bike up.] [talking] That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower.
 Seymour, cleanup! [Seymour licks up the tomato sauce.] Good dog!
 He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!
 So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
 His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.
 Seymour!
 Good news, everyone!
 Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
 Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
 So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
 I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
 But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
 I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back.
 Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down and opens the can.] Here's to another lousy millennium.
 What the--?
 That's for Seymour.
 Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
 Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
 He could dig up bones.
 Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
 [on phone] This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.
 Are you two gonna be done soon?
 Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
 [indifferent] That's nice.
 Ah, there! Perfect!
 Finally!
 Come on, boy! Come back to life!
 What? I'm in the middle of something.
 Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
 I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! [He kicks him.] Ow!
 May yet? Really?
 So Seymour might still exist?
 Then I'm goin' in after him.
 He'd come after me!
 Then all hope is lost. [He lifts himself up and looks at the lava.] Goodbye, Seymour.
 This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. [He cries. The ground starts to shake and Bender erupts through it with Seymour.] Bender!
 Yeah!
 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
 Stop the cloning.
 Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
 I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. [He picks up Seymour's fossil.] I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago.
 Over here!
 Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
 Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
 You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.
 Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
 So let's open the gifts.
 Hi!
 Congratulations!
 That's birth for you.
 [voice-over] After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me.
 Alright. I'll take the red rocket.
 Hello? Pizza delivery for... [Fry takes a piece of paper from his pocket.] D. Frosted Wang? [Fry grunts.] Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?! [Ipji, Terry, and Lou step out of the cryo-tube shadows and burst out laughing.] One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny.
 And... And then they burst out laughing a second time. [All but Fry laugh. Fry sighs.] I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
 Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm. [Shots are fired from outside the building, piercing the window that is the closest to the crew. Fry falls down and screams.] I got shot in the leg!
 I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity. [Fry takes his shorts off and gives them to Hermes.] Here are my shorts.
 Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy.
 That's the plan.
 I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me.
 Hi! I'm Fry.
 Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!
 Sir! Yes, ma'am!
 Wuh— What happened?
 Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light.
 Light 'em up.
 SunnyD commercial.
 DNA and career chip, please.
 The cat! Is it alive or dead? [Schrödinger is not given the time to reply.] Alive or dead?!
 Says you.
 Tomorrow I have.
 That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future.
 Whoa!
 On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?
 What's pink pocodots?
 [extendedly] Woo!
 Look! The clock says 5:08. [Fry looks at his wrist.] It's 4:30 right now!
 You're under arrest for future murder!
 He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone.
 You too.
 Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy.
 In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work.
 Hello? Anyone? [Fry grunts.] There's never a cop around when you need one.
 The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he? [Fry zooms in, revealing the thief to be Bender. Fry gasps.] Bender?!
 Good afternoon, individuals. [to Bender] Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?
 Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?
 I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday.
 Are you familiar with this particular location?
 Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?
 Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime.
 You wrote "Commit the crime"!
 There's gotta be some way to stop Bender. [Fry strokes his chin.] Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence. [Fry continues moving the photographs around. He stops at the one showing the gun.] Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk? [Fry rewinds and zooms out, revealing the shooter to be himself. He gasps.] That's me. I recognise the face.
 No! No! What have I will have done?
 Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?
 [confused] You... And— And the Chief?!
 I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave.
 [on the video] I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave.
 See?
 [on the video] Just get outta here. [Fry puts the gun down and closes his eyes.] Go!
 So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!
 Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!
 That's all the proof I need. [The camera zooms out, revealing that Fry is pointing a gun at Bender.] Put the bottle back!
 Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!
 Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!
 Pickles?!
 Like watching Leno.
 Hey!
 Funny thing about destiny. [Fry points his gun at Pickles.] Sometimes fate has other plans. [Fry shoots in Pickles' direction, hitting the invisible safe, which redirects the shot to Bender. Bender screams, drops the bottle, and falls down.] Oh, nuts.
 [off camera] Did you get that, Chief?
 I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge on his helmet and a hologram of Bender sharing the malt liquor in the Planet Express conference room is projected from his nose.] You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge and the hologram disappears.] Bender would never share!
 So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy.
 Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender. [Fry lifts up his NNYPD badge. Zoidberg, Amy, Professor Farnsworth, Leela, Hermes, and Bender are sitting at the conference table. They all cheer.] But then I got fired for tipping off Bender.
 Ruh— Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion...
 Executive?!
 I feel better about myself!
 Sure. We talk about it all the time.
 No. Burn!
 What does it taste like?
 If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
 Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.
 Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
 Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.
 Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
 Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
 No fair!
 It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
 What happened?
 That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
 [whispering] Dude! Over here!
 And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
 Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
 Ow!
 [whispering] Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
 [from outside] Come on, Leela. You can do it!
 [from outside] Whoa! What are you doing?
 Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
 That's impossible because my time is worthless!
 Hand it over.
 Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
 Can you translate it?
 I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
 Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
 Is it done?
 Stop! [He falls through the roof along with some noses.] Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!
 Close.
 I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
 I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
 Let's see what tools we'll need. [Hammer.] Uh-huh. [Screwdriver.] Uh-huh. [Bending unit.] Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set.
 Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
 I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
 There's no bus to Jersey City.
 I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those.
 Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings.
 Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
 Yup.
 Check.
 [shouting] Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!
 Nope!
 Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?
 Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
 You'll barely regret this!
 Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
 Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
 Captain Yesterday!
 [à la James Brown] Wow!
 Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--
 From everybody?
 Give several reasons why.
 Or do we? No, I guess not.
 And I can't take life anymore.
 Who's the perp?
 Pack of highly. Got it!
 Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.
 [sad] That was uncalled for.
 Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper.
 Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
 But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?
 Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
 El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
 Man, this costume is so damn heavy!
 Ow! That ... didn't hurt.
 So this is your lair?
 OK, take it easy!
 That seemed unnecessary.
 Oh, yeah!
 I guess, as long as you think it's right.
 [standing in mud, surrounded by flies] This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
 Sith? What the Hoth?
 Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.
 It's payback time, Sploder! [Fry's gun fires a beam that tags Sploder then falls flat. Fry presses a button on his gun and the beam retracts.]
 If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.
 So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die.
 It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real.
 [He tastes some of the puddle with his finger] That's not urine, it's oil.
 How much time does he have left, Professor?
 [He puts his hand on Bender's shoulder] Well, at least you can plan accordingly.
 Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
 Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?
 What was wrong with your date last night?
 Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
 Why's everyone wearing those rings?
 I think they look cool.
 No way! We've got so much in common.
 Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
 Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
 A delivery?
 I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
 Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
 Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
 Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
 Wow!
 [teasing] Leela's got a boyfriend!
 I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
 Wow! I never would have thought of that!
 What just happened?
 Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
 We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
 No good! It's full of steam!
 You wanna try escaping again?
 Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
 Really? Why?
 What does that mean?
 Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
 Where'd they all go?
 I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
 The planet's kerploding!
 Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
 What? What are you talking about?
 How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
 No!
 Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
 Pew!
 We're heroes!
 Whoa! Letters like "U" and "R" can mean words like "You" and "Are". Here, Leela, "U-R-2 Cute".
 I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
 And you got a cage for the lion!
 Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you. [He picks up a handful.] "I Love You." Hmm, too conventional. "You're My Man." Ooh, so close!
 Whoa!
 Maybe we hit a space cow.
 Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
 The ship? But you just started dating.
 You have much to teach us.
 Huh? [He gets up and presses a button by the window. It slides up, revealing Ship hovering outside. Fry rubs his eyes.] Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
 Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'.
 Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?
 Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
 You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
 What's happening? Space cow?
 Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
 Same as everyday, got it.
 I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
 Yeah, I know [He eats one of the hearts and makes a disgusted noise.] Ooh! How 'bout this one?
 Um, Leela?
 [suffocating] Oh, nothing.
 [gasping] Happy Valentine's day.
 Bender! Are you OK?
 Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
 Erth. [He mimics laser fire as a spaceship blows up the planet.]
 So? What do you think of my comic?
 Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!
 It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads.
 I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
 Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache.
 Wow. Thanks! [He rips the mustache off Aragonés' face and puts it on. Aragonés screams: ¡Ay, ay, ay!] If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book.
 Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found.
 Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
 So? Give me your honest praise.
 That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles [He begins dialing his cell phone.]
 Sorry. Never mind.
 If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote.
 Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
 Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do? [He looks at the comic. The superhero is crying.]
 [He jumps in front of Leela.] Ray-blocking power! [He is disintegrated.]
 Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch.
 Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew.
 Whoa!
 [off camera] It's a spaceship graveyard.  [on camera] Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
 Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener.
 Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'. [Fry removes his hand from Leela's shoulder. Amy, Zoidberg, and Hermes have stood up.] You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession.
 Okay... [Fry looks down.] That's a good point.
 Poop! [Fry laughs.] Poop!
 A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest! [Fry points at the other camera with his left hand.] We need to cut the line!
 Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
 [off camera] Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
 You know it!
 Who's it going to?
 Is it dangerous?
 Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
 Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
 What was your minor?
 I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
 Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!
 Oh, yeah? [He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket with "Notice of Failure to Graduate" written on it. The CICC logo is a Ferris wheel.] Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
 What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
 Aww, thanks for believing in me.
 Oh, I don't know. [Farnsworth walks past with his crate on a hover trolley.] Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
 [writing] Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. [He points his pencil at Farnsworth.] I'll be there!
 See you in class!
 Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds. [There is a knock at the door.] A woodpecker.
 Oh, right, cool. [shouting] C'mon in, roomie! [He opens the door but there is no one there. He looks down and sees a monkey wearing a bowler hat and carrying two cases.] [talking] What the--?
 My roommate's a monkey?
 You know each other?
 Is he genetically engineered?
 I understood the word "hat"!
 You want a banana?
 I don't like you.
 This is gonna be a cakewalk!
 Swish!
 I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
 Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
 So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?
 Sorry, I overslept.
 It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
 I hate that rodent!
 That'll show him.
 Now these monkeys I like! [The monkeys chomp the bananas and jump around again.] What's that? You wanna come out?
 Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
 You mean peer pressure?
 Look out! He's got a gun!
 Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.
 Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.
 Thanks, Professor!
 [screaming] Ow!
 I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
 Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!
 Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
 There's our man!
 No, the banana, the banana!
 Banana, banana, banana!
 [shouting] No.
 'Preciate it, Guenter!
 Guenter! You're alive!
 Remember this place, Leela?
 Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together.
 One Leela, please. And use your finest balloons.
 LEELA!!!
 Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her!
 Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender, I always thought me and her would...grow old together.
 What's the bad news?
 She wasn't my wife!
 Leela! You're alive!!
 Bender, can I come in and talk?
 Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality.
 All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her, but what I realize now is I can't spend my life without her! So tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me!
 Whoa!
 Uh, question. What if you had a special moment that you wish could go on forever? Could the time button make it last as long as you wanted?
 Uh, yes, I'd like an engagement diamond, please.
 I'll take...this one.
 Hello, stranger! This is my first time here! Do you sell diamonds?
 I guess what I'm saying is, the next time you almost die, I want it to be as my wife! [Leela gasps. Fry turns to Elzar.] The clam, Elzar.
 Leela...my love...[sniffs] will you—
 Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
 Not really.
 Hey, who's this guy?
 I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.
 I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
 Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
 Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
 Yes, please.
 Oh, uh, OK.
 Yes, uh, eight spoons.
 Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.
 Violent media? What a load of--
 No!
 Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
 In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. [He tries to open a can of "Quantum Leek" soup and jabs himself with the knife.] Ow! [He bangs the tin on the table and sobs.] [crying] I'm hungry!
 W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
 [pointing] Hey, the TV's getting away!
 Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.
 Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
 It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
 There! Finished!
 [snappy] It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!
 Ow!
 And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
 Yes!
 Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
 There it is!
 Is anything not a robot?
 Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
 Yeah.Why?
 What's so funny?
 Wait a minute. Have you been using my toothbrush to polish your ass again?
 There's metal flakes on it and they look like ass flakes.
 Because I'm Fry.
 A hidden camera for my bathroom.I suspect a certain robot of unauthorized butt brushing.
 I'll take it!
 Your attention, please. I'm sure you're all wondering why I gathered you here today.
 I hereby, in front of all of you, accuse Bender of polishing his ass with my toothbrush.
 Ha-ha, we'll find out who's lying, my friend. Because I planted a spy camera in our apartment! Let's just see what you were up to last night while I was asleep.
 Okay, get ready. [nothing yet] Uh, keep watching. [still nothing] Let me fast forward a little. [what do you think?] Huh. Well, sorry, Bender. I guess I owe you an apology Hey, wait! What's going on through that doorway?
 You stole my kidney!
 You ate my kidney?
 She ate my kidney!
 What's happening?!
 I didn't know we had a panic room.
 Aw, man, why do I have to team up with him?
 You go first. I don't want you locking me out there like HAL.
 The only person I trust is myself. Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes!
 I don't even know what a gyroscope is. Wait, I have an idea.
 Fry and Bender! A winning combination.
 Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.
 Is it safe to come
 Okay, to see if you're the real Bender, I'm gonna ask you something only he would know. On your last birthday, what gift did I get you?
 Me neither.
 That's not something I would know.
 Um, what color is my shirt?
 Good point.
 Thanks for telling me, buddy. And to be honest, I am jealous of how shiny your ass is, and sometimes at night, I unpolish it with sandpaper.
I trust you, too.
 Get away from us, you monster.
 But we saw him change shape.
 So no one's dead?
 Ooh. I think it moved.
 We can't ever tell anyone what really happened.
 Can I trust you?
 Hey, what you watching?
 It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
 You're gonna be the ships cook?
 Bam!
 So this is Little Neptune?
 [pointing] Ooh! What's this?
 Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
 Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
 I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. [He waves to an alien.] What up?
 See?
 Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
 Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
 Can't imagine why I would.
 I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
 [shouting] Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
 Yeah, OK.
 That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
 My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
 Ow!
 Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
 Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. [He looks across at the setting sun.] Oh, come on! Go down already! [The sun finally sets.] Ah!
 Hello? Anybody home?
 No! It wasn't me!
 I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
 It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
 You might.
 I gotta go with Bender.
 Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
 Hey, thanks! [He takes the package and opens it. It is a sign saying "Please Don't Drink The Emperor!"] Wow! This got here just in time.
 Um, how about that one?
 On second thought, I'll take that one.
 You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
 There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
 Will there be cake?
 There you go.
 Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
 So?
 80,000 years?
 Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
 Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
 Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
 Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
 Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
 Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
 I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. [A panel slides across on a portrait and a Trisolian tries to drink Fry with a straw.] Quit it!
 What up?
 Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
 (reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
 My tummy hurts!
 Ow!
 What am I gonna do?
 But won't that crush my bones?
 I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
 That's a great idea! Crying.
 It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
 What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
 These things happen.
 Phew! That's a load off my mind.
 She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
 What the hell is that?
 This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
 I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
 Is she alright?
 No. No!
 This can't be happening.
 All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. [He throws his crown across the room.] I wish I had died instead of her.
 Leela! You're alive!
 Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. [Leela smiles then stamps on his foot.] Ow! What was that for? [She slaps him.] Hey, come on! [He bursts into tears.] That hurt!
 [crying] Oh, now I understand.
 [crying] Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
 Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
 Oh, you're welcome.
 It got us a lot of customers!
 Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!
 Sounds fun.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.
 We are cleared for takeoff.
 Uh, preparing for takeoff.
 Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?
 Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.
 It's too hot.
 That sounds hard.
 Also, my shoe that fell off.
 Don't worry about it.
 My lucky shoe!
 Never bet against me being stupid.
 Wait. Why didn't that hurt? [Fry screams effeminately.] My wing-wang's gone!
 Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.
 I have no opinion. [They get on the hammock.] Well, good night.
 Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.
 Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—
 Who're you, stranger?
 Ow! Yay!
 Aw, man!
 And there's a robot scratching post. [Robots bat around a beer bottle on the scratching post.] You should try it out, Bender.
 [shouting] I get it!
 [shouting] Oh, now I get it!
 Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
 Hey, where's Bender?
 Bucket of hot dogs?
 Butt massager engaged?
 Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. I— I lost my controller.
 Shoot your weapon, Private!
 Man!
 You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback.
 Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you.
 Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time.
 Definitely. Or... Somewhere else.
 Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators.
 I miss the old, illiterate Bender.
 Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?
 Alright!
 [sad] Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to...
 I dunno. [happy] But someday we'll find out. [sad] Won't we?
 I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever.
 You're the best friend I have left. [sad] An' I barely even know you.
 [angry] What are you, Randy? A complete moron?! [sad] I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is.
 [angry] Aw! You're no help at all! [sad] I'm gonna go kill myself.
 [off camera] Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant. [on camera] That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning.
 What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?
 I like those odds!
 [inside the barrel] Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money [screaming, extendedly] back! [back to normal] Ow! Ow!
 That was not worth three-thousand dollars.
 Hello? Anybody?
 Bender?! Are you in here?!
 But— Bender?! What happened to you?
 Try harder!
 Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!
 But— But Randy said—
 Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me.
 Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?
 No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore.
 Any word from Leela?
 [sad] She always liked not being observed with a telescope.
 [happy] I knew 'e cared about us!
 Leave me alone.
 Yay!
 Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?
 Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me: What's gonna happen with me an' Leela?
 Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?
 Leela?!
 [off camera] It's good [on camera] to see you. [sad] Is it good to see me?
 [off camera] Things [on camera] like me or... Things like this badminton racket?
 It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless.
 Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot.
 A tomato.
 Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen? [He takes a bite out of the sandwich.] Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!
 That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
 Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
 You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
 She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow! [Leela hovers down and pulls Fry away by the hair.] Ow!
 I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
 Well, my lead pipe hurts a little.
 No.
 I've had better.
 [looking away] Really?
 What about what?
 I'd love to!
 Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. [He hold the flowers out to Leela.] For you.
 I don't think so. [He marches up to Sal.] Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
 Anything.
 Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
 No, it's about you and me.
 Bender's not involved. [He reaches out and holds Leela's hands.] Leela ... I love you.
 Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
 Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
 Please. [She pours.] I need something to settle my stomach.
 If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
 Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
 Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
 I think the view's perfect already!
 Wait. In a minute.
 They don't have you to inspire them.
 When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday.
 What I've become.
 There's just something I have to find out.
 I'm about to. [He holds up his holophonor.] Leela, let me play for you one for time.
 Please, it's important to me.
 I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts. [He reaches around to hug Leela but he knocks the vase of Leela's flowers off the table with his holophonor. The vase breaks.] Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
 Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
 Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
 I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!
 Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!
 Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
 Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?
 Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?
 I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them.
 She said, "Go!"
 Hey, where's Amy and Bender?
 And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
 [Walking up] What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?
 I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires. [He winks.]
 Cool! Can you turn into a race car?
 Professor, who's debating for your side?
 No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
 Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
 Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
 I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
 Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?
 Shall we say eight o'clock?
 Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
 So, what? Shorts?
 Boy, this A.C. is incredible! [He shivers.] I'd better turn on the heater too. [He does and the fuel gauge starts to go down. They pass Hg's Fuel, the only fuel station on the planet.] [shouting] Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
 [shouting] Yeah! [He pushes a button and two glasses and a mixer comes out. The fuel gauge drops further.] We're slowing down!
 [shouting] Who wants pop-tarts? [He puts the pop-tarts in the toaster and turns it on full. The engine stops, the heater and A.C. go off, the mixer stops and the car jerks to a halt, then falls to the ground. Amy gasps and sees the fuel gauge is empty. Fry takes his shades off and sees the sign to Hg's Fuel; 4750 miles one way, 4750 miles the other way.] Uh-oh!
 What are you doing?
 Phew!
 Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
 I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?
 Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
 Yeah.
 Kind of.
 And it led there again when we got home.
 What? No!
 [whispering] It's working, they think we're making out. [They laugh then juggle.] Wait, why aren't we making out?
 Wow! We're great kissers!
 Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
 Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
 Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
 You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
 I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!
 Am I? [shouting] Am I? [talking] Face it, I'm a prize catch. [He belches.] I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
 Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.
 Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? [He looks over Amy's shoulder at Leela. She shakes her head.] Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
 Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
 Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
 That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
 [from inside] Pardon me, excuse me.
 Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
 Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
 Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
 Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
 How badly?
 Where is it?
 Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
 Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
 Oh, that. [He turns and sees Farnsworth sweeping behind them.] Maybe we'd better talk in private. [whispering] I'll meet you in the closet.
 Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
 I just think we should start seeing other people.
 I'm sorry, but it is.
 Huh?
 Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
 [happy] Oh! [disappointed] Oh!
 Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? [He turns to Amy.] In private?
 This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
 Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
 Thanks.
 Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
 And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
 What does it do?
 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
 Oh, God, it's true!
 [simultaneous] Thanks. [He watches the door.] Where is she?
 I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
 Uh--
 [whispering] She seems a little old for me.
 Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
 But you just said--
 Well, ma'am, I--
 No, but I control this arm.
 Wait, come back, uh, darling.
 Oh, jeez, get a room!
 Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.
 Nooo! [Gary drops his card onto the check.] That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. [He tugs at his head.] Ooh! Ow!
 Oh, Leela!
 [whispering] Thank you.
 Can I live without it?
 So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.
 Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
 Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. [He touches his neck and kicks himself.] Ow! Cool! [He does it again.] Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
 I guess so. [Bender laughs and puts his arms around Fry and Leela and pats them.] Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
 Hey, Hermes!
 Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
 Hey, yeah!
 Cool! Let's see this one!
 Yeah, I wanna see that.
 I'll take a small Slurm.
 Uh, OK. [The robot puts a tiny cup under the machine and it fills with a drip. Fry takes it and walks away. He trips and it spills onto his shirt.] Oh, man!
 [sarcastic] Ooh, this is real futuristic!
 No, I didn't!
 Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
 [shouting] Bender rules!
 Wow! Thanks, Hermes! [He raises it to his head.] I-- Hey! Cut that out!
 Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
 Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
 Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
 That's all. [slicks his hair back to normal]
 Well, why is– those things?
 Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead.
 We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!
 And the others?
 Are they dead?
 Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
 Hermes Conrad!
 Amy Wong!
 And the rest!
 [Looking inside] Bender! Are the steam cells working? [Bender's antennae gets out and pokes Fry's eye]
 I'm on it! [Fry leans down and blows air in Bender's ass offscreen] It's not working!
 Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela? [Leela gets out of the machine] Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?
 Poke harder, damn it!
 My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
 But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?
 Maybe you're right.
 Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
 At least it's something to distract me from Leela. [He adds two eyes] Nah. [One of the eyes falls] Now that I like for some reason.
 I sure do, honey.
 Hey, I was nuzzling that!
 Alive? [clears throat]
 I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you. [holds her hand, but then looks at the real Leela] I mean her—Wait, help me out here.
 I agree.
 [shaking her hand] Okay.
 Really?
 [disgusted] Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
 No! [runs over to Leela's body with a blernsball bat] I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela! [hits her with the bat on each word] I! Love! You!
 [kisses Leela] Goodbye, my love. [he sobs heavily]
 Leela?!
 Uh, coma. Sad.
 Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you.
 I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?
 Leela?  Leela Leela?
 A gun?!  D-Do I really need to—?
 But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
 Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. [accidentally drops the gun which shoots at his chest area] Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. [screams]
 I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!
 [from the tape of him at the urinal] I sure love Leela.
 Hey, where's my shoes?
 [putting on his clothes] Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
 Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—
 Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?
 Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer.
 Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!
 Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?
 Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.
 I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love.
 Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky.
 Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
 Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
 Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time.
 Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole.
 Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about you—
 Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!
 What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there... [Wide shot of the sky above New New York. The comet is floating above the sun.] Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars.
 Exactly.
 A man can sneak off to do two things.
 In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger.
 Comet kaboomination in three, two—
 The diamond still didn't break! [Fry sniffles.] [sad] Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you. [Another explosion is heard, and gets the attention of Fry and Leela, who gasp. Close up on the comet, which breaks in half. One half begins to float towards the sun.] [continued, off camera] It went kersplitters!
 [angry] Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!
 Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you. [The two halves then finally meet, causing the rainbow to shatter into miniature diamonds, which falls onto New New York like snow.] Whoa!
 Leela, my love, will you marry—
 [angry] Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
 [angry] Leela! No means no!
 Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
 I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
 That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that.
 Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
 I will tell you something that's no joke. [Fry stands up and puts on a helmet.] I will lead the defence fight.
 That will show them our peaceful intentions.
 Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything.
 Or perhaps by odours!
 What if we hire a buttered geisha?
 You an' I are enemies now!
 I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
 OK.
 Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here! [He opens the door and hesitates before he puts it in.] Hm? [He reads the "Warning: Do Not Put In Microwave" label, tears it off and chuckles. He puts the packet in the microwave and presses the button. The popcorn fizzles and blue light leaks out of the microwave and begins to engulf the room.] Hey, what smells like blue?
 Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
 Ooh! My popcorn's done!
 Aw! It's less popped than ever.
 We're gonna crash!
 Bender, are you OK?
 Yo!
 My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
 Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell.
 Got it.
 But existing is basically all I do!
 It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos.
 That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! [Screaming, he runs and pushes Enos out of the way of the slow-moving Jeep, which turns right before it gets to them.] Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
 [whispering] I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
 That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here! [He stoops to Enos's crotch.] [shouting] Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!
 [shouting] No time! Run! Run to safety!
 Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
 Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
 Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee.
 She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
 What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive. [A flame in the kitchen flares and Fry gasps.] Fire! Look out! [He leans forward and knocks the table over. The cutlery slides off and a knife lands inches from Enos's crotch.] Oh! You almost got neutered.
 For me it is! [He stands up.] I'm getting you outta here!
 OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
 Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist.
 Well, I killed my grandfather.
 I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
 Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
 Then you're a braver woman than I.
 Uh, how far is it?
 Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
 Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
 I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
 Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
 It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
 But-- But won't that change history?
 Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!
 [shouting; from ship] He's dead! Sorry!
 Yay!
 Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
 [shouting; from ship] Bender!
 Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!
 No. [The metal detector beeps.] Wait!
 He's alive! [Leela and Farnsworth cheer. Leela digs and pulls Bender's head from the ground.] Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
 [voice-over] Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
 And that's how you play the game!
 Michelle, baby! Where you going?
 I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
 Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! [He sits down on the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy millennium.
 What the--?
 My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!
 Cool! Just like in Star Trek! [The door closes on his head.] Ow!
 Uh, Fry.
 Can I ask you a question?
 Uh...
 Sort of.
 What's with the eye?
 Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
 Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
 My God! A million years!
 Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
 That's great! What's the little guy's name?
 Eurgh!
 Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. [A buzzer buzzes.] What's that?
 Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
 What if I refuse?
 Fine!
 But I don't like being a delivery boy.
 Keep that thing away from me!
 See you in a thousand years! [He starts to walk out but hesitates. He walks back and changes the freeze time to five minutes.] You owe me one.
 Whoa!
 Cool! [He steps into the tube.] Um. Cross Town Express?
 Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. [An impatient robot joins the queue behind him. It is more or less human-shaped, grey, with an antenna on top of its head.] Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
 It doesn't look so shiny to me.
 Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
 Help! What's happening?
 Why would a robot need to drink?
 Really? What do you do, Bender?
 You any good at it?
 What?
 Wait! You're the only friend I have!
 Yeah, ever since I was six.
 Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! [He crouches down behind Bender.] Don't look! Don't look!
 Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
 This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
 Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
 Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!
 Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
 Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
 C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
 Come on, Bender! You can do it.
 Yes!
 I don't know how you did that.
 Good Lord! What is this?
 It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
 This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
 My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
 Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
 No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
 My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
 Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. [He holds out his hand to Leela. She gets the implant gun ready. Fry cringes and looks away. The gun clicks but Fry feels nothing. He opens his eyes and sees Leela drop her own chip on the floor.] Your chip. What are you doing?
 Why?
 What is the matter with you?
 Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
 I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
 Whoa! A real live spaceship!
 No!
 I'll get us out of here.
 Blast-off!
 So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
 Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
 This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
 Cool! What's my job gonna be?
 So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
 Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
 Shh! What was that sound?
 I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.
 Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.
 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
 I get it!
 That proves it!
 Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
 You doin' alright out there, buddy?
 [turning on his lamp] Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
 Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
 Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go... [He "coos".] But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. [He walks into a clearing and looks around. Birds fly out from trees and the ground begins to shake. A strong wind blows leaves and things past Fry and a darkened flying saucer appears from over the trees. It lights up and beam of light engulfs Fry. He looks up and unshields his eyes.] Oh. Just a flying saucer. [shouting] Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. [A tube extends from the spacecraft and zigzags around à la the Windows 3D Pipes screensaver.] Wow! Nice tube. [It sucks him up.] Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say "Probe 1"?
 Amy, you won't believe what happened ... [She looks up.] ... it was so scary that you wouldn't-- [She screams and runs.] I know, but listen, it gets even scarier.
 That's what I'm trying to tell you. See-- [The staff gather around.] Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
 Tell me what?
 What?
 [poking his face] My God! They must have taken it last night.
 In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up.
 I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
 I'll never have another moment of happiness.
 [taking off the glasses] Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh.
 Like me!
 My nose is an aphrodisiac? [He retches.] I'm gonna drop a barf!
 Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
 It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
 Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
 Nope. Uh-uh. Ew! [He pulls out a photo of him and Slurms MacKenzie and points at his nose on the photo.] Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
 Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
 [sadly] Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
 My nose! Light of my face!
 Hey! You burned my cheek!
 No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it! [He sniffs.] And those lilacs on the table.
 Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--
 Hey, what've you heard?
 OK, you can have my nose.
 Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
 But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
 However huge it might be.
 Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
 Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
 So, what can I get you this evening?
 I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
 So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
 Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety! [It flips over and rolls through a campfire, setting it and Fry alight. It hits a tree and the door falls open. Fry steps out and pats out the fire.] Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
 Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
 Yeah!
 Zoidberg. What is that?
 Bender. Wait. Won't the bugs just run out and infest some place else? Like our building?
 Okay.
 Woohoo! Ran-dy!
 What's the catch? She looks normal.
 Uh... No offense, Zoidberg, but... how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench?
 Are you nuts?! If she could smell, she'd smell you! Your relationship would be over faster than you can say—
 Dude! You made the finals! Congrats!
 You're gonna put sequins on your hat?
 Seems like a sold plan.
 That's true.
 Okay.
 Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?
 Touché!
 Ow! Bender!
 No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!
 My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.
 Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
 Ow! It bit my finger!
 Yup.
 He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
 [voice breaking] This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
 But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
 [voice breaking] Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.
 Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
 [voice breaking] A movie. [deep voice] A movie, ma'am.
 I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
 [whispering] They're onto me!
 We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
 Yeah!
 Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!
 And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!
 Yay!
 [voice breaking] C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
 I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.
 I wanna hear a space story!
 Professy's back! [He lets go.] Ew! You smell like smoking! [He sniffs.] And drinking.
 We did it! We're the right ages again!
 I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.
 The fabulous person!
 Fabulous friends!
 [cheering] Alright!
 He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
 Since when have you been in the biz?
 Leela, we're missing the premiere. [Leela wears a dress and hair sticks.] My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
 Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. [He looks out of the window and a skeleton floats past.] Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!
 It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
 What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
 Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
 We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
 Still a little nervous? [Amy burps.]
 It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. [After they leave the hangar, Katz's cat leaves the ship.]
 Over here. I wanna hold him.
 Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
 Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
 Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
 Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
 Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
 He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
 Hurry!
 With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
 [from lounge] Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...
 But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
 What up?
 [singing] I'm walking on sunshine! [He hums and gargles.] Sunshine!
 What?
 Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
 There you go.
 [shouting] Yeah! You show 'em!
 Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything. [He open his wallet but it is empty.] Oh, right. Never mind.
 Yay!
 Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.
 Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen.
 Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. [The two kiss, then exit the room.]
 Well...
 Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
 I have a thought. [Cut to the two of them in bed, both smiling. Fry blows a bubble with his gum and it pops around his mouth.]
 Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas.
 Me, too.
 Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
 What? What is it?
 [Adjusting his tie in the mirror] Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run.
 Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D.
 A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step.
 Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
 Leela, header! [He prepares to knock it over to Leela, but it easily tramples over him. Cut to Bender smoking a cigar. A ball hits him, but he doesn't move. It bounces off him then hits a wall and rolls into a hole. The hole lights up blue. Cut to the scoreboard: "1-1." Cut to Fry riding on top of a ball. He manoeuvres it around a hole and heads toward an opponent riding another ball.]
 But... But...
 Hmm? [He spits a piece of butterscotch into his hand.]
 I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?
 No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
 Yeah. I do love her.
 I'll just take that to go. [He is poured a coffee and it's handed to him.]
 Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. [They walk through the doors.] I'm just happy to be here with you.
 No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast.
 You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
 I'm not talking to you!
 Thank you.
 So, Colleen, you look really nice.
 And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye.
 Pretty good. You?
 Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. [His Oxygen Pack displays "OXYGEN SYSTEM FAILURE" on the screen accompanied by a beeping noise, but a bolt of lightening quickly blows out the screen.]
 Silence! [The crowd goes quiet.] I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence.
 A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! [Tentacles enter into the crowd through the fire hydrants.] Open your necks and receive the love!
 Thus sayeth the tentacle, "Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle."
 No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak. [A laser points at his forehead.]
 Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. [He grabs part of the tentacle that is attached to him and pets it.] It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. [A second laser appears on his forehead and a cocking gun is heard.]
 I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by (quoting the syllables) "Hollywood." But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. [He looks up at the anomaly. Leela slips off her boot and pulls out another gun to aim at Fry's forehead while he turned away. A third laser appears on his forehead.] Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing.
 Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
 What, Bender? Is something wrong?
 I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. [A shot of Fry's back reveals the tentacle reaching from Fry's upper neck to lower spine in a very scar-like manner.] I've been kind of preoccupied.
 [while putting on his vestment] Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion.
 [He puts on his Pope hat.] No.
 Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. [He squeezes/yanks on the tentacle and is yanked through the window of the apartment and out into space.]
 Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!
 So we got her, huh? Bring her in!
 Hello, Colleen.
 Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?
 She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
 Love the tentacle, honey.
 Come on out, guys! [Chu, Schlomo, Ndulu and Bolt come out of hiding.] There's enough love for everybody! [They all hug and raise into the air higher.]
 The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
 Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
 What's that?
 Love the tentacle!
 Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name.
 Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of "he" or "she," we are to use the word "shklee." And instead of "him" or "her," we are to use the word "shklim," or "shkler."
 So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!
 Ew!
 We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv.
 Get him! [He points at his own face.]
 Hey, wait a second.
 Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date.
 [He sniffles.] Aye. [He hits Delete and Yivo's name fades from the display.]
 No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy.
 Hey, Bender, you seem perky today.
 I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
 Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only.
 Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is...
 This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well...
 Thank you, Nixon. [He clears his throat.] Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race.
 Okay.
 We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. [A large hand shows off the ring.] We're moving in with shkler. [The crowd cheers.]
 We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. [He kisses a tentacle and Leela exclaims in disgust.]
 You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you.
 Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
 What's happening?
 Bender, stop destroying heaven.
 He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}
 Um... [He coughs.] Is it dry up here?
 Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
 But...
 Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
 Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?
 [He sighs.] Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home. [He turns around and looks at Leela.] I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
 That's true. [He walks over to Amy.] How about you, Amy?
 Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy.
 What? How can you say that?
 Controversial?
 OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
 Bender?
 No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
 I am at ease.
 The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
 Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
 Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
 Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... [Bender swirls his glass around.] ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
 If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
 Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
 What's happening?
 Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?
 You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?
 He didn't?
 Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. [He puts on Leela's jacket and Bender's hat.] To the ship.
 Madam, I am in command now.
 Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
 Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
 So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
 [mumbling] I 'unno.
 We're bein' eaten by a giant spider!
 What is it? I'm on the edge of my butt!
 [pointing to one of the buttons] Look, it has Slurm Loco! It's the extremeiest!
 Wow! You can talk? [angry and taking out a quarter] Shut up and give me a Slurm Loco!
 Oh, snap!
 [walking towards Bev with a quarter] Yeah, I need one more Slurm. [Fry puts the quarter in and Bev gives Fry another Slurm Loco. While he drinks it, he puts another quarter in and gets another.] And one more to wash that Slurm taste outta my mouth. [While he drinks, he puts in yet another quarter and gets another drink.]
 So I went to the bathroom an' my pee was green. [putting another quarter in Bev] Pretty neat, huh?
 [As Ruth tries to switch him off] Yow!
 [putting another quarter in Bev] Just sittin' here turnin' quarters into urine. [slurps his Slurm]
 [putting another quarter in] Nice! Hate me because of the brightness of my skin!
 You okay, ma'am? I think your soda water broke.
 My God! Bev just had a baby in my cup!
 I know, right?
 [approaching Bev] There, there. [puts another quarter in and drinks]
 I left my window open and moths got in.
 Bend some other stuff!
 [gargled] Mazl tov!
 Or is there?!
 Merry College Registration Day, everyone!
 Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
 Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
 Do you think we should?
 Woo, yeah!
 That's the best thing I ever saw!
 That was great!
 Yeah, Leela.
 What are we supposed to do for money? [He opens his wallet.] All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... [He holds it up in a bag.] ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
 Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
 Our what?
 And then what happened?
 Ow!
 They're OK.
 Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up. [The freezer pings and opens. A man walks out, clutching his head.] Bathroom's that way.
 So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.
 Nope. Straight line. [His control panel pings.] Ah, the Probulator's done.
 Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. [The machines start making noises and the man screams.] OK, it's about to start.
 Nothing like a power nap.
 I ordered a pizza.
 Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
 [checking his watch] Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
 OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
 No. [They pass Weird Al Yankovic.] No! [They move onto the next one.] Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
 Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
 Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
 Oh. [He coughs.] So, how did you wind up getting frozen?
 The weasel?
 I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
 I love this job.
 Showtime! [hoarse] I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
 Michelle!
 I don't know. Is it really you?
 Who wants to know?
 I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
 I'm sorry.
 Sorry.
 Uh, sorry.
 [voice-over] Sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
 That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?
 Who was it?
 Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
 Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
 Hey, guys.
 I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle. [Everyone claps.] Michelle, this is Leela. [Michelle screams.] This is Bender. [Michelle screams.] The Professor. [Farnsworth waves. Michelle looks at Fry and he nods. She screams.] Hermes and Amy.
 And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
 All what?
 But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
 Yeah, they're great, huh?
 Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed. [He picks up the implant gun.] Hold out your palm. [Michelle whimpers.] What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.
 Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
 Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.
 Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
 You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
 Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
 The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
 No, you brought us here.
 Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
 There!
 It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
 They'll save us. [The kids point guns at them.] We're saved!
 Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
 I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.
 What do I need, ulcers?
 Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
 Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
 What's death rolling?
 Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
 [sadly] Beth said that?
 Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha! [He snatches the bandana and dances around.] I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
 I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
 Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
 Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: [whispering] I'm leaving you.
 There must be people somewhere.
 Yes! Footprints! And hand prints? [The mist clears some more and he sees the foot and hand prints are signed by Clark Gable. Some more signatures appear including those of Florp, Dame Calista Flockhart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Slurms MacKenzie, Calculon and James Mason.] But? What's happening?
 Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
 So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
 But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
 But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
 But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
 And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it-- [A limo pulls up and the window comes down. Inside, Michelle and Pauly Shore drink champagne.] Michelle, baby!
 That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?
 Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres.
 Ew!
 Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
 I don't see you anywhere.
 Sure haven't.
 [thoughtful] Really?
 Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
 You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
 But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.
 Bah! I think she looked fine before.
 This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
 No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
 What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
 And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. [Farnsworth blubbers and waves.] Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
 Amy's a klutz from Mars.
 I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
 You are a calculator.
 There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
 Yay!
 It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
 Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
 Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ... [He yawns.] ... three sheep.
 I love these things!
 Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
 [pointing] Looks like this planet is next in line.
 I'd hate to be those guys.
 Leela back yet?
 You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
 Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
 Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
 Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?
 [angry] I just let you back in!
 Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?
 Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
 Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
 Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. [He takes a head in a jar out of the box.] This was our first president, George Washington. [The staff stare blankly. Amy twitches and Farnsworth scratches his head.] Let's review. Who was our first president?
 Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
 Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.
 Thanks!
 No, Leela. Brain make people smart.
 Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
 Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? [He gasps.] The libary!
 I'm here to kick your ass.
 That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! [He throws a book at the brain. It bounces of it harmlessly.] OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! [He rubs his temple.] Thinking ... thinking...
 Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. [The Brain groans again.] Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
 Seriously, I can't think of anything. [The Brain laughs, it's strength returning. Fry picks up some books.] Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!
 Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
 Where are we?
 Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!
 Follow him! It's our only way out!
 Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?
 [shouting] Come on!
 You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--
 Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!
 Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.
 Yes! I'm free! [He begins to climb a bookcase. He stands on the top of it with a book in one hand. He grabs a light with the other.] Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!
 [writing] Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph... [He laughs.] Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end. [He closes the book.] There! [He writes "Fry Trick The Brain" on the cover.] Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.
 [jumping up] I did it! [He holds up a book and addresses the "camera".] And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
 This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
 [whispering] Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
 I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
 A shrimp? [Bender's laser guide appears between Fry's eyes.] I find it a bit hard to believe that--
 Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. [He laughs and bends over. Bender hits him with his fishing rod again.] Ow! My small intestine!
 [shouting] Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
 It's diving!
 How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
 How do we do that?
 Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
 Did what?
 I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
 I can't swallow that.
 [blubbering] I think I saw a mermaid.
 A mermaid!
 No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
 What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
 Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
 [muttering] Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it? [The mermaid knocks on the window and Fry gasps.] [talking] It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! [Bender turns up the volume on himself and snores louder. The mermaid beckons Fry. He heads for the door then remembers something.] Oh! oxygen!
 Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
 What?
 I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
 Aw, yeah!
 I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
 Oh, thanks. They're called pants.
 No kidding.
 Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
 And sometimes it doesn't.
 You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
 Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
 Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
 I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
 That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
 Aw, shucks, Colonel.
 Wait. I'm not going with you.
 Realise it? I don't even understand it!
 I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
 Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
 You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
 Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
 Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
 [gasping] Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
 Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
 Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
 Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
 Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
 I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
 I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. [He picks up a photo of Leela and him riding on the back of an angry looking Zoidberg.] Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
 Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
 The Grumpy Snail. [He plays the holophonor. An image of a grumpy snail slowly crawling along a branch forms. He plays a bad note and the snail turns around and glares at him angrily.] Sorry!
 Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
 It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
 At, uh, uh, a concert.
 [quietly] Pretty boy.
 That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
 Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
 Sure would. [He shrugs.] Oh, well. Goodbye.
 He-He-He is? [He turns around.] Great! Wait, what's the catch?
 I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
 Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
 Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
 Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
 [impressed] How'd you do that?
 At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
 Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.
 Alrighty!
 Uh-oh.
 Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
 Yes, you did.
 Uh, show him in.
 Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.
 But I've never written an opera.
 But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... [He turns and looks at Leela, who sits at the table gorging on a buggalo leg dripping with barbecue sauce. He smiles and turns to Hedonismbot.] OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
 Leela! [He stands up.] You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
 So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
 [shouting] No!
 Look, what do you want?
 Never!
 [singing] Destiny has cheated me,
 No! [He pushes the Robot Devil away from Leela.] Stop! Take my hands!
 My hands. My horrible human hands. [He gasps.] And what did you do to my nails?
 But I can't play anymore.
 Whoa! Hey!
 Me? Um, can I phone a friend?
 I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play.
 B, nail, final answer! [A buzzer sounds and Fry's chair blasts off.]
 I never stop to think about it.
 Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart.
 Einstein is a hard name to remember. [The Professor pokes him in the eye with the Fing-Longer]. Ow!
 [He sniffles] But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
 What turned them to stone?
 [He takes a beard from the cabinet] Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall.
 [Wearing the beard] Indeed so. Most indeededly.
 What is it, Professor?
 Maybe we can figure it out.
 Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts. [He is run over by a hoverbus.]
 I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me.
 Not even a card.
 Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?
 Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome.
 My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.
 Hi, Animatronio.
 What makes it so great?
 Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years. [Tentacles reach out of the water and grab a man posing for a picture.]
 Hey, look. Coins.
 [Looking through a window.] What's this dump? [They are surrounded by Roman Architecture.]
 It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
 At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?
 Hi, Animatronio.
 [Sitting in the chair of the flying machine] You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly.
 Bye, Animatronio!
 I don't know. Let's ask this guy. [A man is standing in front of them.]
 That's what I was gonna say!
 It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh.
 Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
 So what do people do for fun here?
 I sure do!
 How your football team?
 No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
 Now that I can do. [He tries to sit in mid-air but fails.] I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart.
 I don't even know what language you're speaking.
 What? Who possibly think you're stupid? [Two people come near the bench.]
 He looks stronger than you, too.
 I can see myself in your shiny button.
 You mean these? [He holds out the plans.]
 [Fry finishes his "musical piece" and the crowd starts booing.] Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio! [The crowd cheers.] I mean da Vinci! [The crowd starts booing again.]
 And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
 Are you crazy, Professor?
 I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot. [He jumps on the machine.] There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got.
Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all! [He tries to nail in a nail but it hits him in the eye. He stumbles and gets caught in the gears.  Fry is being sent through the gears of the machine, finally jamming it. The machine stops and falls over. Leonardo and the Professor run out of the way. The audience laughs.]
 It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say.
 Also, that I'm not much to look at.
 [shouting] I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?
 [shouting] Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?
 So, will you go out with me?
 Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
 Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
 No.
 [from vent] Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
 Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
 Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
 There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?
 So, heads or tails?
 Oh.
 I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
 Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
 You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree.
 Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
 Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
 Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?
 I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
 Why do they call it that? [The ship rocks back and forth; parts of the worm are seen outside the window.]
 Woah!
 Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there.
 Like the deadly Prius.
 Yuck, but yay!
 Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
 Bender, wake up! [Bender mumbles as he starts to come around.] He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
 Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
 Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
 Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
 I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
 It'll be a rich, full day.
 [shouting] Bender, no!
 [shouting] You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
 I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.
 Stop rubbing it in!
 Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
 Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Thanks, eagle eye.
 I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
 Look, are you the original were-car or not?
 Knight Rider wasn't evil.
 [leaping around] Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!
 [gasping] Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! [Bender rams Fry's legs twice. Fry tumbles onto Bender's roof, through the sunroof and inside Bender. The seatbelt comes around him.] [talking] Oh, thanks, Bender. [The seatbelt chokes him.] [choking] Too tight! Too tight!
 Bender, I'm alive! [He climbs out.] You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. [He opens a beer.] Here's to you.
 I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
 Oh no! I'm late for work again!
 Sorry, I'm late.
 Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet.
 Oh no! I'm late.
 Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late.
 You're not mad?
 Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
 Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there.
 Woohoohoohoo... [He notices Leela is not pleased.] ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
 No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you.
 I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
 Does it have to be nude?
 If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!
 But I have a date.
 I wouldn't wanna do that again.
 Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there.
 [to card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine.
 My card!
 Did we go too far? What time is it?
 The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
 [frustrated] No! They did it! They blew it up! [The camera pans to reveal a monkey Statue of Liberty.] And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen? [Camera pans to reveal a bird Statue of Liberty.] And then the birds took over and ruined their society. [Camera pans to reveal a cow Statue of Liberty.] And then the cows. And then... [Camera pans to reveal a strange slug-like Statue of Liberty.] ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe? [screaming] Noooo!
 I'll never see Leela again.
 And then we can go home.
 How do you know we're time travellers?
 [joyous] All right! We can go home!
 I can eat. And fertilise.
 Bender, they had a backwards time machine.
 Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine.
 So let's keeping going forward.
 The Cavern on the Green.
 I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late.
 [on card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and... [He leans closer to the card.] ... I love you. [In the background, the time machine goes off. The card vanishes away from Fry.] My card!
 You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?
 To the end of the universe.
 So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot.
 Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?
 Sounds about right.
 Bye, last proton.
 Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?
 Did anyone else see that?
 It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?
 Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
 I'm gonna grab another beer.
 It's okay. They're not going anywhere. [He finally retrieves a beer and stands up.] Where'd they go?
 History.
 I'm almost there, Leela.
 Stop!
 All right!
 Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela.
 Sorry, I'm late.
 Really?
 That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
 Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it.
 Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
 Cool, it's just like the good old days!
 Hey, Leela, get a picture of me being "mugged".
 Yeah, I asked a cop once. It means "Up yours, kid".
 Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth.
 In New York? Bathrooms.
 I'll show you. [He hops over it.] Whup.
 No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.
 We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
 Hey, my girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains.
 C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.
 Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo-- Uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!
 Nope. [He starts the engine.] No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. [He moves the gear lever.] Nice! Listen to that baby purr.
 It's just like riding a bicyc--
 I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
 How's that robot I ran over?
 You mean he's--
 I don't get it.
 So, uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?
 Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
 Uh ... sure.
 How's that?
 Uh, I can't get any lower than this.
 I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
 [unsure] Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.
 Uh, no, no, that's alright. [She leans on him and he struggles.] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like.
 Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
 He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.
 I'm talking about Flexo.
 No, I'm not. Mark my words: Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
 Can I touch it?
 Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--
 Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
 Wait, let's go by rank.
 Flexo outranks me?
 Don't point that at me.
 Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.
 I'm not prejudiced.
 Caught you! [Flexo panics.] I saw you looking at the atom!
 Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?
 Yeah, well here's a funny joke: I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
 That I will.
 Good.
 Good.
 Good. [Flexo doesn't reply.] Good.
 Well, that's eight hours.
 Finally, the atom is safe.
 No.
 He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?
 Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.
 Aha! [He opens a drawer but there is no Flexo, just Leela's panties. He rummages around anyway.] Uh, searching ... hmm.
 I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
 [suspicious] Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
 Give it up!
 Or maybe, he never left at all! [He pulls the scarf off the robot.] Wait a minute. You're Bender.
 But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
 100,000?
 Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.
 Flexo!
 Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
 Bender? You stole the atom?
 Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.
 I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
 Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.
 Oh. [He clears his throat.] Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
 [shouting] C'mon!
 I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
 Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck? [Leela sighs and reluctantly kisses him on the cheek.] I meant tongue luck.
 I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
 Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. [The bell rings and only one horse leaves the box. The other horses stumble out tiredly. Bender chuckles.] Come on, number six! Move it! [Number six yawns and sits down.] Don't do that! What are you-- [He yawns.] Man, it's contagious!
 That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough. [He reaches into his shirt.] I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to! [A sudden gust of wind takes the dollar from his hand.] Oh, no you don't! [The dollar falls into a Slurm machine and comes back out and flies away again. It comes to rest on an overhead wire. Fry climbs the pole.] I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar! [He reaches over to the dollar but it is out of reach. He climbs down the pole and returns with a rake.] If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--
 Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
 Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
 Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!
 Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!
 Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
 I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
 Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around.
 I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?
 It is?
 Here's the entrance. [He steps onto the ladder in the manhole.] From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over.
 Look, up ahead.
 Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing. [He stands on top of a newspaper box.] [shouting] Howard Stern is overrated! [He laughs and runs to a phone box and deliberately knocks the receiver off.] Uh, oops!
 And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
 Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?
 Cosmic F.
 Outer space.
 [dancing] The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G.
 Deep space?
 Hey!
 The robot? That's similar to mine!
 What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
 Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
 Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin.
 Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape.
 Alright, team, let's go find that clover!
 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.
 Gosh! My old neighbourhood. [They walk down a deserted street and Fry points at things.] That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
 You'd better believe it!
 That's right.
 Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?
 Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
 Sure. When he's sober!
 Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
 [shouting; from outside] Mom! Help!
 Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
 Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
 The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. [He opens the vault, flips through some records and takes one out.] Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. [He slips the clover into the record sleeve and puts it back into the vault and closes it.] Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday.
 This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
 This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. [He blows the dust off it.] I still remember the combination: Three. [He turns the dial and tries to open the door.] It's stuck!
 Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
 I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. [He takes a deep breath.] Here goes. [He reaches into the sleeve.] It's gone! [He takes the record out and sticks his head into the sleeve.] The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
 Everything else in here held up OK.
 I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
 You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
 It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
 Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
 First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. [He punches the statue.] And now he broke my hand!
 That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
 I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
 That should have been me!
 That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
 That's what I'm known for!
 So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?
 Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
 I should be the one in that grave!
 Hmm. We lost Bender.
 Aha! My brother's grave!
 It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
 It's clovering time!
 [reading] Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
 And I'm his uncle!
 I can eat a hotdog underwater.
 We can take 'em.
 [to Leela] Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.
 Right. You gonna finish that roll?
 Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are.
 But if anyone asks, say she's an alien.
 Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life.
 You might be right, Hermes.
 I almost feel like we should do something to help her.
 I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go.
 Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela.
 Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding...
 Leela!
 I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people.
 I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so...
 Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now. [He sniffles.] [Voice breaking.] Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela? [The Professor slaps him with the cruise director's arm.]
 [Taking off his clothes.] You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know.
 Any effect?
 I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant.
 Hey, guys.
 I hope so, Leela.
 My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth.
 But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?
 Hey, buddy.
 What goes down, must back up!
 [He is looking at the Land Titanic's manifest.] I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first.
 [He bursts out of a manhole, holding the gemerald.] Let my people stay! [He shoots a beam of energy at the wave of sewage, parting it.
 Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you.
 Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley.
 I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did.
 What the...?
 Dang! Sorry we missed it!
 Really? No, that's not necessary.
 No, it's what makes you you.
 Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
 No, I.... What?
 As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump.
 Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
 Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
 So Leela's in your body?
 That is entirely not true, sir!
 Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
 Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] In your face, Leela. [He walks out, past Nikolai and Bender wash bucket’s body.]
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? [He makes tentacles come out his armpits.]
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Eww! look at her! [Amy leave the room.]
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] That wasn't a little extra weight.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Great food, huh? [He burps out of his gills. The rest of the restaurant groans in disgust.]
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Ew!
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
 [in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah. [Leela turns on the TV and sees what is happening in the UN. They both gasp. Fry's crest pops up.]
 I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!
 Ugh!
 [pointing] Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
 I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
 Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
 Well? How are they? [Leela swallows, her eye widens, and she falls to the ground and starts cramming her mouth with the things. Fry eats one and gasps.] Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!
 [pointing] Look! Here's more!
 Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
 I know, we'll call them Popplers!
 Swish!
 Hey, yeah.
 Hey, business is great.
 Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
 A dollar a dozen.
 How do we sign?
 and  [singing] Pop a Poppler in your mouth,
 Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
 Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
 [nodding] Like Fry! Like Fry!
 People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.
 Turanga?
 I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
 What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.
 You mean--
 That's Leela!
 No!
 Hear, hear!
 Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
 OK.
 How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
 I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
 No I'm ... doesn't.
 The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
 No, you have a healthy glow.
 I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. [Bender belches again. Leela giggles.] Ooh, I felt that one!
 [simultaneous] That's great!
 We don't work for you anymore!
 Yes, sir.
 There. One million papers, folded and loaded!
 Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
 Push, Bender, push!
 Almost there. Just two more bottles.
 It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
 Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
 Wow!
 Are there really giant birds like that?
 I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. [He points to his breakfast.] Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
 Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
 Hi--
 I only have one.
 Uh, is there a human doctor around?
 Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
 [chuffed] Last time I checked.
 Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
 So where are we going anyway?
 The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
 Can I do the countdown?
 Ten ... [The ship takes off, clears the atmosphere and approaches the moon.] ... nine--
 [awestruck] Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
 Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
 That's one small step for Fry--
 Wow! [He turns to the man.] Um, can I have cuts?
 You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
 Let's go, already!
 Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
 I had more but you go ahead.
 But I've never been to the moon before.
 Clear!
 Ready!
 My first space delivery.
 Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
 But you are lazy, right?
 Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
 So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
 This is weak!
 I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. [He tosses his candy floss into a bin and runs to a window.] That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
 I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
 Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
 That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
 I do.
 That's not how it happened.
 This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
 Not for long!
 Agreed. [He drives over craters and flies through the air, cheering.] Yeah! Crank up the radio!
 Yee-haw!
 No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
 Well I'm feelin' lucky! [The car suddenly falls into a huge crater and starts to sink at the bottom.] Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
 We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! [He jumps off the car and starts to sink.] Help me, Leela! [Leela grabs Fry and an oxygen canister and flies out of the crater.] You did it! We're safe!
 It's every man for himself.
 [gasping] I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
 No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
 I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
 Fahrenheit or Celsius?
 Robot daughters?
 Whoa!
 And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
 I guess I can't.
 Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
 It's too low.
 Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
 Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
 It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! [He stamps over it.] Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
 Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
 I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
 The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. [Leela's cold glance becomes a sympathetic frown.] But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
 It's Amy! We're saved!
 [from lander] Well ... close enough!
 Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once. [Fry leans back in his chair and falls off it.] Ow! Quit it, Earth.
 I wish I could go with you, pal.
 Hey, Francis.
 [touched] You remind me of my old friend Bender.
 I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?
 Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley.
 Bender?! [Bender is wearing a hat and overall and driving a hovercarriage that is being pulled by the Crushinator. He looks at the crew. Fry runs towards Bender.] Bender! It's me, Fry!
 Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around.
 Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act.
 Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!
 Sure!
 [sad] If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life.
 [sad] You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
 He really is gone.
 [sad] I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was. [Also present are Amy and Professor Farnsworth, standing up, and Hermes, sitting down.] Hey, where is Francis?
 Stop, Zoidberg! [Leela looks at Fry with interest.] You'll hurt Francis!
 Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!
 Bender!
 To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer. [sad] Maybe the best there ever was.
 Bender?!
 [sad] You're probably right. [Fry shrugs.] I don't really remember what he looks like.
 [happy, screaming] He's alive!
 Oh, no. The firing tie.
 But you can't fire yourself now. We were just getting to know each other.
 Hey, Bender, you should become an executioner. You could kill humans and wear a cool hood.
 In a second. I'm eavesdropping.
 I said not now!
 Oh, loosen up, Amy.
 Hooray!
 Woo-hoo!
 Larger than an American sedan? [He gasps.] How big is the honeycomb?
 But, Leela, we're no good.
 I'm not scared of that at all.
 Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting.
 Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
 Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship.
 Hey, what's this goop?
 Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good? [The honeycomb underneath him gives way and he falls into the jelly. He screams.] Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!
 Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
 We made it! We're alive!
 Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
 Look out! [Leela screams and the bee flies at her. Fry steps in front of her.] You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!
 Leela?
 Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
 Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know. [A large, translucent image of him appears behind him and Leela and they both speak.] There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
 Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
 I want you to wake up.
 Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 Oh, yeah? [The space around them changes to a purple forest.] Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?
 Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
 Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
 You can. All you have to do is wake up.
 Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
 Neat!
 Me too.
 Uh, not everything.
 You have to wake up.
 [crying] Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela.
 Leela! You're awake!
 In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
 The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
 I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
 [whispering; over credits] You too!
 So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
 Put it back in me!
 ¡Ay, caramba!
 Careful, Leela! [Leela turns to Fry.] He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!
 [off camera] Quit complaining! [The camera pans over to Fry. Fry, whose skin resembles that of Garfield, is sitting on the bed.] My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome. [Fry sighs.] I hate Mondays.
 Oh, sure.
 [continued] Leela's fine. [Fry points at Leela with his left hand and at himself with both his hands.] But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
 [over the noise] Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!
 I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
 We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care! [Zoidberg has removed his face from his hands.] [off camera] You're a terrible doctor! [Hermes has crossed his arms. Fry points at Zoidberg with his right hand three times. Amy puts the kidney in her left pocket with her right hand.] [on camera] Nobody wants to see you ever again!
 Hey!
 Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
 Kill-check two is go!
 And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
 Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. [Fry points at the Professor Farnsworth Yeti with his left hand.] And I've never heard of Yetiism.
 My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
 Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty.
 What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move! [Amy and Zoidberg hop to it. Zoidberg woops.] Amy? Mission profile? [She hands him a card and he moves it backwards and forwards. The card is a hologram of a stick person handing a parcel to a dragon.] Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?
 What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time! [He throws it back at Zoidberg.] I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
 Wh-What? You went without me?
 But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
 I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
 But if I'd been there I--
 Look--
 Bender's great--
 Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.
 Chaz?
 So? I'm just as important as him. [Leela and Bender stare.] It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I [quietly] don't do it.
 I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
 Um, OK. Let's go bowling.
 Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me.
 You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
 Um ... uh...
 Oh, no! Please! No! [The ground shakes as Nibbler drops one.] Perfect!
 Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
 I'm as worthless as this trash can.
 Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.
 D-D-Did you just talk?
 Like what?
 Are you my mommy?
 Eh?
 Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
 Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
 Oh, snap!
 Maybe later.
 Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
 Because I'm so smart?
 I did do the nasty in the past-y!
 So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
 What's so evil about that?
 So they're trying to learn things?
 Those bastards!
 I'm as mad as I've ever been.
 Now it's personal.
 OK, let's go through this once more--
 Brains!
 Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
 Who?
 I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
 Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?
 Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time. [He speaks into the console.] Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--
 Wait, wait, wait. [He speaks into the console.] What really killed the dinosaurs?
 Uh-oh!
 Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
 You got it, poindexter!
 Well at least I did one important thing with my life: Leading good to victory over evil!
 The day I got frozen? What about it?
 Ah, forget it then.
 OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?
 [on screen] Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!
 Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! [On the screen, Fry blows his noise maker and leans back on his chair. Nibbler walks out from underneath the desk.] Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?
 [on screen] What the--
 I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
 You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
 No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
 [crying] But it was my life.
 Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
 Really? I can go back in time?
 That is interesting. Why?
 Everybody wins!
 I hope your calculations are correct.
 Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!
 Gotcha!
 Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you.
 But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
 Not if you don't freeze me.
 Well, why couldn't you just ask me?
 Of course not. I love the future.
 Because I don't like being used.
 Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
 What?
 You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
 Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks.
 Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.
 Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.
 Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine.
 Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you.
 Then I am the most important person in the universe.
 [over credits] Yes!
 That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now. [He walks over to the coffee machine.] Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please.
 Uh, I'll have a coffee.
 Whale, please.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!
 [shouting] This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! [He spits it out.] And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
 Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. [He goes to sleep for less than a second and wakes up and grabs a cup of coffee.] Coffee time!
 Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!
 Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!
 So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
 Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
 [shouting] What happens if we lose?
 Hey, Leela, look at me!
 There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
 C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
 What's happening?
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
 Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
 Is that a problem?
 You mean we just--
 Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
 [sexfully] Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
 Ow!
 Hooray for Leela!
 Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something.
 You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.
 You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?
 I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
 Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
 Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
 I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?
 Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--
 Of course not.
 No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--
 What?
 Fine. Break my heart again.
 How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
 I don't know what I'm doing.
 Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.
 Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
 Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
 She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
 Oh! [He walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. As the ship gets further away from the nebula Fry sees the stars around it form an "O" in a huge message that reads "I Love You, Leela".] That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
 [screaming] No! [The doomsday device implodes and the nebula, the stars and Fry's message disappear. Fry stares at the empty void. Leela and Bender walk in.] Did you see it? Did you see it?
 No, not the explosion!
 [quietly] Nothing.
 Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
 I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
 Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor.
 Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
 What's that?
 And this ham gum is all bones.
 Cool effect!
 Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
 Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
 Mind if we sit with you?
 Good point ... I guess.
 Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
 Cyclops.
 It's creepy here.
 And then the battle's not so bad?
 What's happening?
 The enemy! They're balls!
 Oh, right.
 [shouting] Bender! No!
 That wasn't cowardice.
 That doesn't sound too bad.
 [singing] I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
 What's the word, uh, sir?
 We don't have long!
 OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.
 Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
 You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
 [squinting] Hermes?
 Leela!
 OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. [He puts on his helmet and sighs.] Will you push me?
 [shouting] Thank you! [He pulls his ripcord and hits the ground as soon as the parachute deploys. Balls bounce on him and he kicks a few away and rides one like a space hopper.] At last, war has made me into a man.
 Stop! You can't say the next word.
 Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
 Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
 No.
 Bender!
 Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
 What are you showing right now?
 Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre "world's blankiest blank".
 I'm in!
 Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
 Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
 That's the one.
 [unenthusiastic] Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
 But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
 Not covered!
 Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!
 Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
 It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
 Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.
 Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
 [screaming] Nooo!
 We're all gonna die, aren't we?
 A what?
 You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
 W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
 I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
 Sure, I just like TV better.
 Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
 Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
 Wait, I know her.
 That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
 It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
 Magic. Got it.
 Beer-- I would think.
 Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
 Let's put on a show.
 OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
 Places, everyone.
 Lights! [Bender opens his chest cabinet and a bright studio light shines from it.] Camera one! [Bender's right eye extends and whirrs.] Camera two! [Bender's left eye extends and whirrs.] Camera three!
 Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
 I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.
 No, no! Go to commercial!
 Married? Jenny can't get married.
 But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.
 You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
 Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.
 And action!
 And ... cut!
 Way to overact ,Zoidberg!
 Yep. [He turns the TV on, sits down on the couch and puts his feet up on the table.] It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows: At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.
 You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
 What words? Star Trek?
 She's all yours, buddy!
 Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.
 You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
 Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
 Aha! You can't escape it!
 Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--
 I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
 But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
 Oh, dip!
 It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
 Welshie?
 I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
 Say it in Russian!
 Now say "nuclear wessels"!
 [screaming] Welshie!
 Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
 Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
 Cool! A Star Trek convention!
 Uh ... Khan?
 You have my fan script?
 [smug] Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
 Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
 This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
 Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
 Of course! It's so simple!
 Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
 Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
 And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
 Well, here goes nothing.
 It hurts!
 All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
 Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
 We've decided to work together.
 Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! [to himself] Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.
 Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
 We did it!
 Melllvar's got a spaceship!
 Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
 Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.
 Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
 Episode 10, Balance of Terror.
 And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
 So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
 Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
 I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
 Yuck!
 What's that weird sound?
 Aw, man!
 Yee-haw!
 Where?
 Oh. Oh!
 Where?
 Pft, that's not scary!
 Hook on the hand!
 Man in the attic!
 With pleasure. [spookily] Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
 And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
 Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again.
 Where?
 My God!
 Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
 Hm.
 Yeah!
 Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
 Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
 Sack?
 Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
 Ah, futuristic!
 Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
 Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
 Maybe he has a parasite.
 [simultaneous] No, Amy!
 Eck!
 Oh, baby, I'm there!
 Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. [shouting] Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
 Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?
 [nudging Zoidberg] Who's the lucky lobsterina?
 You and me both, brother!
 I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
 Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
 Look how ridiculous they look.
 Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
 Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. [He takes Leela's hand.] Just look her in the eye, start crying and say [fake crying] "I've never been so happy."
 OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
 No. Tell her she's special.
 Well, tell her that. And then?
 No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. [Zoidberg raises his hand.] Yes?
 You're not even trying!
 OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
 OK, go ahead.
 [whispering] You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
 [whispering] Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
 [whispering] Now ask her how her day was.
 [whispering] You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
 [whispering] That's normal. Just nod your head and say "Uh-huh".
 [whispering] Third date!
 [whispering] Turn it over.
 [wiping a tear] That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
 Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
 No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
 Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!
 Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
 But--
 What?
 English, please?
 But I don't want her!
 Leela!
 Fatal.
 [shouting] Shut up!
 Shh! Nobody correct him!
 But it's a fight to the death!
 Uh-oh.
 Hey!
 Aha! [He hits Zoidberg's hands with the nutcrackers and Zoidberg flies over his head and lands on his feet.] Oops!
 My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? [He raises his arm.] One reason. [Zoidberg cuts his arm off with one clean click of the claws. Fry looks at his lifeless arm on the ground and pulls his shirt up around his wound.] You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
 Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
 Ow, ow! Ah!
 [holding up his arm] I'll lend you this.
 Hey, hey.
 You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
 Tough call.
 No biggie.
 [laughing] Yeah!
 I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?
 [from ship] My legs!
 This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
 Hi!
 Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
 Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?
 [hoarse] Trees down!
 Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
 Oh, what the hell! [He takes a run up and slides after Hermes and Zoidberg. He hits something at the bottom.] Ow!
 Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
 Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
 Xmas, huh? [He sighs.] Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
 Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
 Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
 They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
 This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
 Everything's changed.
 Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. [Amy flies around the room and crashes.] This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
 What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. [Enter Leela, drying her tears.] Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? [She runs out crying more.] Yoiks! What was that about?
 My God! Poor Leela.
 I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
 Ow! Thanks.
 Whose blood?
 I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
 So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
 We'll see. I like to haggle.
 Say what?
 I know about Santa Claus.
 Wow! 2801! Anyway...
 There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
 No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
 That's funny!
 You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. [He looks at an eight-legged sausage dog, Bongo the rabbit from Life in Hell and a tiny giraffe in a birdcage. He doesn't like any of them.] Just give me your best animal.
 That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
 That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
 Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
 Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. [The parrot squawks.] Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? [It squawks again.] Shut the hell up! [It bites his nose.] Ow! [He drops the cage and the parrot flies out.] Stupid bird! I know where you live.
 Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
 Aha! Cornered!
 Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
 I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
 Merry Xmas, Leela.
 Oh, boy! It's Santa!
 Well check it twice!
 No! I swear!
 Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
 I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!
 Goodbye, Leela. [They hug.] Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.
 Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
 [shouting] Help!
 [shouting; from outside] Help!
 [shouting] He's gonna blow!
 Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
 Look, the food isn't what's important.
 The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
 [singing] Santa Claus is gunning you down!
 [innocently] Yes. [sad] It's the only song I know.
 I'm not havin' any problem.
 [dressed as Doingg] I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num.
 [dressed as Doingg] I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.
 [dressed as Doingg] But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
 [dressed as Doingg] Now I get it!
 I hope you win, Leela.
 I'm the star of the show.
 Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
 [dressed as Doingg, singing] I like to relax with a spinach martini.
 Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job.
 Yes, please!
 To think I borrowed money from you!
